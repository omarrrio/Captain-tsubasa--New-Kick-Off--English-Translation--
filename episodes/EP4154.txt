//Toho is not going to lose<LINE>
//against a guy in this state!<END>

//Oh, a very violent tackle from Hyuga!<LINE>
//Misugi not being in the best shape,<LINE>
//will he be able to avoid it?<END>

//I have to move...<LINE>
//I hope my heart holds up...<LINE>
//Just a little longer,<LINE>
//at least enough time to score another goal!<END>

//Misugi avoids the tackle!<LINE>
//It's hard to believe,<LINE>
//after seeing him avoid the tackle<LINE>
//with this magnificent footwork,<LINE>
//that this boy was exhausted<LINE>
//just a few moments ago.<END>

//This is impossible!<END>

//Misugi brings the ball up<LINE>
//into Toho's half of the field.<END>

//I'm going to end this!<LINE>
//I'm going to create a decisive opportunity<LINE>
//and score against Wakashimazu!<END>

//I won't let you pass!<END>

//Misugi, be careful!<END>

//!!!<END>

//You're not getting away so easily!<END>

//Misugi is sandwiched<LINE>
//between Sawada and Hyuga!<LINE>
//How will he get<LINE>
//out of this tight spot?<END>

//I...I have to score!<END>

//!!<END>

//Misugi is preparing to shoot!<LINE>
//He completely ignores<LINE>
//the pressure from Hyuga and Sawada!<LINE>
//Misugi is going all out<LINE>
//with this move!<END>

//!!<END>

//He managed to shoot!<LINE>
//Misugi has just struck a shot<LINE>
//incredibly fast<LINE>
//before Hyuga and Sawada<LINE>
//could reach him!<END>

//The ball is heading towards Toho's goal...<END>

//!!<END>

//GOAL!<LINE>
//I can't believe it!<LINE>
//Misugi's shot disappeared<LINE>
//right in front of Wakashimazu!<END>

//But it's clearly a goal!<END>

//This is impossible!<LINE>
//A shot that disappears?<END>

//Wakashimazu was like he was knocked out!<LINE>
//He couldn't move a muscle!<END>

//So? Did it go in?<END>

//Misugi just collapsed on the ground!<END>

//Misugi!<END>

//...<END>

//I'm okay...<LINE>
//My heart is still beating...<LINE>
//It's still beating!<END>

//Captain!<END>

//These two years of rehabilitation have made<LINE>
//my heart stronger!<LINE>
//Hyuga, I can fight against you!<END>
