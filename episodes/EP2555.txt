//Hyuga is ahead of Sawada!<END>

//Sawada and Hyuga didn't have the chance<LINE>
//to play together during this tournament!<LINE>
//Furthermore, Hyuga seems faster<LINE>
//than before!<END>

//Will Sawada be able to keep up<LINE>
//with the new Hyuga?<END>

//Just like the Tachibana brothers<LINE>
//from Hanawa, Masao and Kazuo,<LINE>
//or Tsubasa and Misaki from Nankatsu,<LINE>
//Hyuga can count on me!<END>

//We form the Toho's golden duo!<END>

//Oh! He receives the pass smoothly!<END>

//Hyuga and Sawada demonstrate<LINE>
//spectacular synchronization!<LINE>
//They are in perfect harmony!<END>

//Nice pass, Takeshi! Thanks!<END>

//Oh! But Tsubasa arrives on the side<LINE>
//to block the ball!<END>

//I won't lose the ball<LINE>
//Takeshi just sent me!<END>

//Hyuga shoots anyway!<LINE>
//It's a Tiger Shot!<LINE>
//Tsubasa is literally<LINE>
//knocked out of the game!<END>

//And goal!<LINE>
//Tsubasa's action slowed the ball down,<LINE>
//but Morisaki's desperate dive<LINE>
//wasn't enough to reach the ball!<END>

//Listen up, Tsubasa!<LINE>
//I'm going to keep widening<LINE>
//the gap between our two teams!<END>

//...<END>

//You'd have to be blind not to see<LINE>
//that you're not in your best shape!<END>

//And to silence those who might<LINE>
//attribute our victory to your injury...<END>

//I'm going to score as<LINE>
//many goals as possible!<LINE>
//Do you hear me?<LINE>
//I'm going to beat you and crush Nankatsu!<END>
