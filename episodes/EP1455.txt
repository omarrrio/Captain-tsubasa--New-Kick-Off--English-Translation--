//Misugi passes the ball to Tsubasa.<LINE>
//Only he can organize Japan's play.<END>

//Now Tsubasa is heading towards Pierre!<END>

//The key to the game lies in my ability<LINE>
//to dribble past Pierre.<END>

//But I have pulled myself together<LINE>
//thanks to Wakabayashi and<LINE>
//the others' encouragement.<LINE>
//Let them know that things have changed.<END>

//I will not give up, no matter the opponent!<LINE>
//I will fight until the end!<END>

//That's the only way I will become<LINE>
//the world's best player...<END>

//We're about to witness a duel<LINE>
//between Tsubasa and Pierre!<END>

//What is he thinking? He couldn't<LINE>
//dribble past me earlier.<LINE>
//He should try something else.<END>

//But now he's charging at me<LINE>
//just like before.<END>

//Either he really thinks<LINE>
//he can dribble past me,<LINE>
//or he's completely crazy.<END>

//Pierre, listen to me carefully!<LINE>
//I'm crazy, crazy about football!<LINE>
//And this time,<LINE>
//I'm going to dribble past you!<END>

//I'm going to win with speed!<END>

//Tsubasa made it past! He evaded Pierre,<LINE>
//not thanks to his technique,<LINE>
//but thanks to his speed!<LINE>
//He's moving at an incredible pace!<END>

//Pierre couldn't do anything<LINE>
//to stop Tsubasa!<END>

//Tsubasa won the duel!<END>

//Impossible...<END>

//France took a hit<LINE>
//with their captain Pierre's defeat.<END>

//It's Roberto who taught me this dribble,<LINE>
//but he's probably on a plane<LINE>
//to Brazil now.<END>

//I'll never forget everything<LINE>
//he's done for me...<END>

//Drive shoot!<END>

//Tsubasa shoots without hesitation!<LINE>
//He follows up his dribble<LINE>
//with a Drive Shoot!<END>

//The ball leaves a magnificent<LINE>
//arc-shaped trajectory in the<LINE>
//French sky!<END>

//Gooooooaaaaaaal!<LINE>
//What a Drive Shoot!<END>

//Super!<END>

//Three years ago, the same rain was falling<LINE>
//in the semi-finals, and Misugi dominated me<LINE>
//with his exceptional technique.<LINE>
//I was about to give upâ€¦<END>
