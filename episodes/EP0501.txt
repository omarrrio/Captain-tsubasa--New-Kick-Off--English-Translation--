//The first half just ended<LINE>
//and Nankatsu lost their advantage.<LINE>
//We can say that the path<LINE>
//to a third consecutive title<LINE>
//has become a little steeper.<END>

//OK, it's fine.<LINE>
//We'll just play the second half<LINE>
//without conceding a goal as usual.<LINE>
//Hmmm... There isn't a single<LINE>
//one who's as strong as me.<END>

//It's over, we can't win.<END>

//Tsubasa... Taki and Kisugi...<LINE>
//All injured...<END>

//Guys, this is not the time<LINE>
//to give up!<LINE>
//We're only halfway there!<END>

//Taki, Kisugi, how are you feeling?<END>

//We're fine. Just a few scratches.<LINE>
//We're ready for the second half.<END>

//But Tsubasa is not fully recovered yet.<END>

//You're not seriously giving up, are you?<END>

//Never! I won't give up!<LINE>
//It's too early to throw in the towel.<END>

//Besides, I haven't used<LINE>
//my Drive Shoot yet.<END>

//Hmm...<END>

//OK, guys.<LINE>
//Let's get started with the second half.<END>

//Ah... Tsubasa...<END>

//He's right. We have to move forward!<LINE>
//The first half doesn't matter,<LINE>
//no matter what the score is.<END>

//We'll have to give it our all together!<END>

//Just one smile from Tsubasa and the morale<LINE>
//of the other players rises.<LINE>
//Even injured, Tsubasa remains the pillar<LINE>
//of the team.<END>

//OK, let's go!<END>

//And both teams are back<LINE>
//on the field!<LINE>
//The second half finally begins!<END>

//There were some concerns<LINE>
//about the health of captain Tsubasa,<LINE>
//but he's on the field<LINE>
//for the start of the second half.<LINE>
//And it's Nankatsu's turn to kick off.<END>
