//Tsubasa is preparing to shoot!<END>

//He's going to do a Drive Shot!<LINE>
//Remember what we said, Garban!<END>

//Got it!<END>

//Here we go!<END>

//Tsubasa shoots without hesitation!<LINE>
//It's a Drive Shot!<END>

//Huh?<END>

//But the ball isn't heading<LINE>
//towards the goal!<LINE>
//Did he miss the shot?<END>

//No... The Drive Shot...<LINE>
//Hyuga is running towards it!<END>

//Your turn, Hyuga!<END>

//It wasn't a Drive Shot,<LINE>
//but a Drive Pass for Hyuga!<END>

//Tsubasa trusts me!<LINE>
//That's why he made a Drive Pass<LINE>
//instead of shooting at the goal!<END>

//Alright! The ball will drop<LINE>
//downward. I have to rely on its momentum<LINE>
//to take it at the right moment!<END>

//Hyuga seems to want to shoot<LINE>
//without controlling the ball!<LINE>
//With a ball at this speed,<LINE>
//it's going to be hard to adjust his shot!<END>

//Now!<END>

//If I score on this play,<LINE>
//I can finally claim the position<LINE>
//of star scorer for the All Japan Team!<END>

//If Hyuga scores on this play,<LINE>
//it will be one of the best combinations<LINE>
//ever seen from these two<LINE>
//middle school football stars!<END>

//Gooooooal!<LINE>
//This is the first time we've seen<LINE>
//a shot that combines the<LINE>
//Drive Shot and the Tiger Shot!<END>

//The ball has pierced the nets!<LINE>
//It's a goal of great importance<LINE>
//for the All Japan Team,<LINE>
//who have brought hope back to their side!<END>

//Great shot, Hyuga!<END>

//Nice pass, Tsubasa!<END>
