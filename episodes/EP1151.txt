//Don't think you're invincible, Wakabayashi!<LINE>
//My Tiger shot will pierce your net!<END>

//That's what we'll see, Hyuga!<END>

//!!!<END>

//Aahhh...<END>

//I can't believe it!<LINE>
//Hyuga was thrown into the air!<END>

//Schneider...<END>

//But what just happened?<LINE>
//Ah, there's Karl Heinz Schneider,<LINE>
//the Kaizer!<END>

//What a feint!<END>

//What speed!<END>

//Schneider just erased Nitta and<LINE>
//Tachibana in the blink of an eye!<END>

//This feeling...<END>

//I feel the same thing<LINE>
//as when facing Tsubasa!<END>

//Schneider charges straight<LINE>
//towards the Japanese goal!<END>

//But Sawada and Matsuyama stand<LINE>
//in his way!<END>

//Waah!<END>

//Argh...<END>

//No feint this time, he passes<LINE>
//right through the middle and<LINE>
//the two defenders are struck<LINE>
//down in his wake!<END>

//B-but, it's Hyuga's Straight Dribble!<END>

//Schneider speeds towards the opposing<LINE>
//goal and outmaneuvers his opponents<LINE>
//with lightning-fast dribbling!<END>

//We have to stop him!<END>

//Takasugi and Jito, the two giant defenders<LINE>
//of Japan, position themselves<LINE>
//to stop him!<END>

//Oh! He passes the ball back<LINE>
//and circumvents the defensive<LINE>
//duo on the left!<END>

//Kaltz, who was following him,<LINE>
//is he going to shoot?<END>

//Schneider!<END>

//No! He doesn't shoot and passes the ball back<LINE>
//to Schneider!<END>

//Schneider takes Kaltz's pass<LINE>
//in the air and executes a<LINE>
//Jumping High Volley Shoot!<END>

//Gooooaaaal!<END>

//Wakashimazu, with his vision blocked<LINE>
//by the gigantic Jito and Takasugi,<LINE>
//was unable to anticipate Schneider's move<LINE>
//and was helpless against his shot!<END>
