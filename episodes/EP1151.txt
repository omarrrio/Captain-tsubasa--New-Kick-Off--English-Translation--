//Don't think you're invincible, Wakabayashi! <LINE>
//My Tiger shot will pierce your net! <END>

//That's what we'll see, Hyuga! <END>

//!!! <END>

//Aahhh... <END>

//I can't believe it! <LINE>
//Hyuga was thrown into the air! <END>

//Schneider... <END>

//But what just happened? <LINE>
//Ah, there's Karl Heinz Schneider, <LINE>
//the Kaizer! <END>

//What a feint! <END>

//What speed! <END>

//Schneider just erased Nitta and <LINE>
//Tachibana in the blink of an eye! <END>

//This feeling... <END>

//I feel the same thing <LINE>
//as when facing Tsubasa! <END>

//Schneider charges straight <LINE>
//towards the Japanese goal! <END>

//But Sawada and Matsuyama stand <LINE>
//in his way! <END>

//Waah! <END>

//Argh... <END>

//No feint this time, he passes <LINE>
//right through the middle and the two defenders <LINE>
//are struck down in his wake! <END>

//B-but, it's Hyuga's Straight Dribble! <END>

//Schneider speeds towards <LINE>
//the opposing goal and outmaneuvers <LINE>
//his opponents with lightning-fast dribbling! <END>

//We have to stop him! <END>

//Takasugi and Jito, the two giant defenders <LINE>
//of Japan, position themselves <LINE>
//to stop him! <END>

//Oh! He passes the ball back <LINE>
//and circumvents the defensive duo on the left! <END>

//Kaltz, who was following him, is he going to shoot? <END>

//Schneider! <END>

//No! He doesn't shoot and passes the ball back <LINE>
//to Schneider! <END>

//Schneider takes Kaltz's pass <LINE>
//in the air and executes a Jumping High Volley Shoot! <END>

//Gooooaaaal! <END>

//Wakashimazu, with his vision blocked <LINE>
//by the gigantic Jito and Takasugi, <LINE>
//was unable to anticipate Schneider's move <LINE>
//and was helpless against his shot! <END>

//!!! <END>
