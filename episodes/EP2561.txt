//Drive shoot!<END>

//But Hyuga... Hyuga runs furiously<LINE>
//and stands in Tsubasa's way!<END>

//Don't even think about scoring against Toho!<LINE>
//Tiger shot!<END>

//Hyuga is in front of me...<LINE>
//Will he arrive in time to block<LINE>
//the Drive shoot with a Tiger shot?<END>

//It's a duel!<LINE>
//A true battle!<END>

//Oh! This is incredible!<LINE>
//The two players seem to be<LINE>
//evenly matched!<END>

//The ball doesn't move an inch!<LINE>
//Tsubasa and Hyuga are thrown back!<END>

//Oh! Hyuga turns around and falls,<LINE>
//but Tsubasa gets back up!<END>

//This is it!<LINE>
//I'm touching my dream with my fingertips!<LINE>
//Drive shoot!<END>

//Argh!<END>

//Hyuga gets back up and prepares<LINE>
//to block the ball,<LINE>
//but he's not close enough!<END>

//He risks equalizing again...<END>

//I'll stop him!<LINE>
//You'll see what I'm capable of!<END>

//Tegatana defense!<END>

//Ah! He stopped it!<LINE>
//Nankatsu doesn't score!<END>

//Wakashimazu!<END>

//Wakashimazu blocks the shot,<LINE>
//but he loses his balance and collides<LINE>
//with the post with his right shoulder!<END>

//Wow!<LINE>
//The Drive shoot was successfully blocked,<LINE>
//but Nankatsu comes back on the attack<LINE>
//to get the ball!<END>

//Stop them!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu was injured for us!<LINE>
//He didn't do all this for nothing!<LINE>
//On defense!<END>

//Ah! And Tsubasa gets the ball!<END>

//Tsubasa just fell to his knees.<LINE>
//Is he unable to move?<END>

//The ball... My friend came back to me.<END>

//I'll score.<LINE>
//I'll score!<END>

//Oh! Tsubasa gets back up,<LINE>
//ready to do another Drive shoot!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu is still on the ground!<END>

//No!<END>

//I'll block your Drive shoot<LINE>
//with my Tiger shot!<LINE>
//You do your Drive shoot, and I'll shoot<LINE>
//in Nankatsu's goal from<LINE>
//the other end of the field!<END>

//Ragh! Tiger...<END>

//Shot!<END>

//Impossible!<END>

//Hyuga uses the post as a springboard<LINE>
//to shoot, taking advantage at the same time<LINE>
//of the power of Tsubasa's Drive shoot.<LINE>
//Does he really expect to score from that far out?<END>

//What!<END>

//And the ball is sent back again!<END>

//Tsubasa's Drive Shoot was blocked<LINE>
//by Hyuga's Tiger Shot!<END>

//Tsubasa now performs a Jumping High<LINE>
//Volley Kick to clear the ball!<END>

//The multiple back-and-forth of the ball<LINE>
//created a rainbow of light!<LINE>
//You can easily imagine<LINE>
//the power of the shots...<END>

//He's now shooting<LINE>
//towards Toho's goal!<END>

//Raugh!<END>

//Incredible! Wakashimazu is standing up!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu, who was trampled and injured,<LINE>
//tries everything by diving<LINE>
//out of the goal!<END>

//But it's not enough!<LINE>
//Even if he catches the ball,<LINE>
//he will fall into the net<LINE>
//carried by his momentum!<END>

//I have to stop him!<LINE>
//Tsubasa... Nankatsu<LINE>
//must not score another goal!<END>

//He stopped it!<LINE>
//He managed to stop it again!<END>

//Wakashimazu is pushed back into the goal<LINE>
//by the power of the shot, while Hyuga<LINE>
//comes from the side to catch it!<END>

//The ball is stopped just a few<LINE>
//centimeters from the goal line!<END>

//T-Toho foiled the attack!<LINE>
//Nankatsu couldn't score!<LINE>
//Tsubasa's three shots ended up<LINE>
//in failure!<END>

//Yeah...<LINE>
//We did it, guys!<END>
