//That's it. The referee just<LINE>

//ending the second half.<END>

//Neither team was able to score the winning<LINE>
//goal during the previous sixty minutes.<LINE>
//The final of the national<LINE>

//Toho is therefore extended by two<LINE>

//Twenty more minutes of fierce struggle...<END>

//Tsu...Tsubasa!<LINE>
//What happened?<END>

//Hey, Tsubasa!<END>

//Well, guys, we're going to have to play<LINE>
//overtime.<END>

//Tsu...Tsubasa...<LINE>
//Are you feeling okay?<END>

//Tsubasa, I'm sorry<LINE>
//but I can't let you play<LINE>
//any longer.<END>

//You've done a great job,<LINE>
//but you need to listen to the doctor now.<LINE>
//Your leg and shoulder need<LINE>
//to be treated.<END>

//Yes, Tsubasa.<LINE>
//As a doctor,<LINE>
//I cannot allow you to return<LINE>
//to the field.<LINE>
//Come on, come with me to the infirmary.<END>

//Doctor, do you remember the promise<LINE>
//you made to me?<END>

//Which one?<END>

//I'm still standing.<LINE>
//I haven't fallen.<LINE>
//Right?<END>

//Please. Let me go<LINE>
//as far as my body can endure.<END>

//I have to go back on the field<LINE>
//to face Hyuga.<END>

//I'm going to play extra time!<END>

//Doctor, do you really think a<LINE>
//injured and diminished player could have<LINE>
//played as he did?<END>

//When Tsubasa can no longer move<LINE>
//and handicaps the team...<LINE>
//we'll replace him.<END>

//Guys...<END>

//But for now,<LINE>
//Nankatsu still needs Tsubasa.<END>

//Tsubasa, why don't you go rest<LINE>
//on the bench?<LINE>
//It should give you some energy.<END>

//Ishizaki...<END>

//We'll go all the way together,<LINE>
//to our third national title!<LINE>
//Agreed, Tsubasa?<END>

//Yes.<END>

//Just one more match, one match left,<LINE>
//and it's over.<END>

//Hyuga.<END>

//You played well<LINE>
//during those sixty minutes.<LINE>
//So rest up<LINE>
//for the final twenty minutes!<END>

//OK!<END>

//Wakashimazu, you can only use<LINE>
//your right hand now,<LINE>
//but you're still going to be our keeper<LINE>
//for the next twenty minutes.<END>

//Y-yes, coach! Of course!<END>

//And now, the start of extra time<LINE>
//in the final of the National<LINE>
//Junior High School Tournament.<END>

//The match has been splendid, and worthy<LINE>
//of what was expected from a match<LINE>
//destined to crown<LINE>
//the best team in the country.<LINE>
//Nankatsu and Toho both deserve<LINE>
//the victory.<END>

//Will it be Nankatsu,<LINE>
//aiming for a historic third<LINE>
//consecutive national title?<LINE>
//Or will the third attempt<LINE>
//be successful for Toho,<LINE>
//dreaming of their first victory?<END>

//The first ten minutes of extra time<LINE>
//will soon begin<LINE>
//in front of a packed stadium.<END>

//If neither team wins,<LINE>
//they'll both be declared<LINE>
//the winners.<END>

//Friends...<LINE>
//I would never have made it here<LINE>
//without your help.<END>

//But soon I'll be alone,<LINE>
//because after our third<LINE>
//consecutive national title,<LINE>
//I'll leave for Brazil.<END>

//Thanks, friends. Thanks for everything.<END>

//It's up to Nankatsu to start<LINE>
//the extra time.<END>
