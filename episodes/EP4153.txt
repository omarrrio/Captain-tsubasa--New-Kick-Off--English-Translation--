//I can take you all on at once!<END>

//I'm going to mark Hyuga!<LINE>
//And if I get the ball,<LINE>
//we'll launch a counter-attack!<END>

//Okay!<END>

//I'm waiting for you, Hyuga.<LINE>
//I promise I'll stop you,<LINE>
//that's the key to our equalizer!<END>

//That's what I wanted!<LINE>
//Get ready, Misugi!<END>

//Misugi charges at Hyuga to stop him!<LINE>
//But he won't let himself be<LINE>
//dispossessed so easily!<LINE>
//The two players fight for the ball!<END>

//Will Hyuga manage to continue<LINE>
//towards the goal?<LINE>
//Will Misugi manage to stop him?<END>

//Get out of my way!<END>

//You shall not...<END>

//...pass!<END>

//!!<END>

//Misugi!<END>

//What's happening?<LINE>
//Misugi collapsed, allowing<LINE>
//Hyuga to take control of the ball!<END>

//Guys!<END>

//What's happening?<END>

//Wow! Misugi kicked the ball far<LINE>
//away from Hyuga as he fell!<END>

//Misugi!<LINE>
//Okay!<END>

//Musashi gets the ball!<END>

//Musashi launches a fast offensive,<LINE>
//but Misugi is still on the ground!<END>

//Listen to Misugi!<LINE>
//We have to strike quickly!<END>

//Toho falls back to stop<LINE>
//Musashi's offensive!<END>

//Bring it on, you little brats!<LINE>
//Misugi is the only one who can score<LINE>
//against me!<END>

//Will Musashi manage to equalize,<LINE>
//or will Toho's defense hold?<LINE>
//The match may be about to turn!<END>

//Look at that!<LINE>
//Musashi makes a series of dazzling<LINE>
//passes!<END>

//They're making instant passes,<LINE>
//one after the other!<END>

//But there's Wakashimazu in the goal!<LINE>
//He'll never let a long-range shot<LINE>
//go past him!<END>

//Okay!<END>

//It seems that Musashi was influenced<LINE>
//by Misugi's tenacity.<END>

//Toho's defenders can't<LINE>
//get a touch on the ball!<END>

//This is our chance!<LINE>
//It's up to you, Honma!<END>

//Wow!<LINE>
//Is that a decisive pass from Musashi?<END>

//Wakashimazu rushes out<LINE>
//but Honma is already in shooting position!<END>

//I'm going to score!<END>

//Ah! Honma is a little bit faster!<LINE>
//The ball sails towards Toho's goal!<END>

//!!<END>

//Wakashimazu turns around in urgency<LINE>
//and rushes towards the ball!<LINE>
//Will he reach it in time?<END>

//No, he didn't make it!<LINE>
//The ball goes into the net!<LINE>
//Musashi has equalized in the last minute!<END>

//Yes, we did it!<END>

//No! Captain!<END>

//...<END>

//Misugi!<LINE>
//Misugi, are you okay?<END>

//I'm fine.<LINE>
//What's the score?<END>

//We turned your pass into a goal!<LINE>
//We are tied!<END>

//Great...<LINE>
//Well, we can do it,<LINE>
//we can win this match!<LINE>
//One more... We're going to score another goal!<END>

//But Misugi... You're sick...<END>

//Don't worry about me,<LINE>
//I can still play!<LINE>
//I'll play with you until the end!<LINE>
//We're going to the national tournament<LINE>
//and face Tsubasa!<END>

//Let's go!<END>

//Yes!<END>

//Get as close as possible<LINE>
//and shoot with all your might!<LINE>
//It's the only solution!<END>

//Hyuga refuses to pass the ball!<END>
