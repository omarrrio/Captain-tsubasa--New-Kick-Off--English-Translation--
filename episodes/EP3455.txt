//It's the clash between<LINE>
//Matsuyama and Kisugi!<END>

//What?<END>

//Matsuyama wins the battle!<LINE>
//The ball is in play!<END>

//Unfortunately for Furano,<LINE>
//the ball has arrived at the feet<LINE>
//of Nankatsu's ace player, Tsubasa!<END>

//Yes!<END>

//Oh, no!<END>

//Since Matsuyama is marking Kisugi, Tsubasa<LINE>
//has a free path!<END>

//Drive Shoot!<END>

//Tsubasa, who is unmarked, attempts<LINE>
//his Drive Shoot!<END>

//Argh!<END>

//Matsuyama doesn't give up and positions<LINE>
//himself in the path of the ball<LINE>
//still in the air!<LINE>
//But Tsubasa's shot is too powerful!<END>

//Matsuyama is propelled with the ball<LINE>
//into his own goal!<END>

//Captain!<END>

//Ah! Several of the Furano players<LINE>
//who were nearby<LINE>
//rushed behind Matsuyama<LINE>
//to prevent him from entering the goal!<END>

//Furano succeeded in protecting their goal<LINE>
//from Tsubasa's Drive Shoot<LINE>
//at the cost of a collective effort!<END>

//Thank you!<END>

//Okay, guys! Hurry up!<LINE>
//We need to attack to overturn the score!<END>
