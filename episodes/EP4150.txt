//Hyuga scores a third goal with his head!<LINE>
//We are only in the first half,<LINE>
//and he has already scored a hat trick!<END>

//He's not the best striker<LINE>
//in the national tournament for nothing!<LINE>
//With Hyuga, Toho Gakuen is a team<LINE>
//to be taken seriously!<LINE>
//But that doesn't bode well<LINE>
//for Musashi, who chose a defensive<LINE>
//strategy in the first half.<END>

//Coach, let me play!<END>

//Misugi, you'll come on the field<LINE>
//in the second half.<END>

//If they score again,<LINE>
//we won't be able to win!<LINE>
//I'll come off after thirty minutes!<LINE>
//Let me in!<END>

//Musashi Junior High makes a substitution.<LINE>
//Inoue, number 12, comes off and Misugi,<LINE>
//number 14, comes on!<END>

//And here's Misugi!<LINE>
//It looks like Musashi Junior High<LINE>
//doesn't intend to let<LINE>
//Toho Gakuen score any more goals!<END>

//But Misugi isn't strong enough<LINE>
//to play at his maximum<LINE>
//for more than thirty minutes.<LINE>
//Will we see him on the field<LINE>
//until the final whistle?<END>

//You're wasting your time, Misugi!<LINE>
//Toho Gakuen won't lose,<LINE>
//even with you on the field.<END>

//Listen to me!<LINE>
//This is where it starts!<LINE>
//We're going to show them<LINE>
//how Musashi really plays!<END>

//With Misugi in the game,<LINE>
//Musashi goes on the attack!<END>

//And the whistle marks<LINE>
//the resumption of the match!<END>
