//This headband that Fujisawa made<LINE>
//allowed me to keep playing<LINE>
//on the field despite the fatigue.<END>

//?<END>

//But, what is this... ?<END>

//In such small letters that it's hard<LINE>
//to see...<LINE>
//"I love you" embroidered in white<LINE>
//on a white fabric!<END>

//What is it, Captain?<END>

//N-Nothing...<END>

//...<END>

//Excuse me... Let me through!<END>

//Captain!<END>

//Fujisawa!<LINE>
//Fujisawa is leaving for the United States<LINE>
//in the second semester!<END>

//Machida, where is Fujisawa?<END>

//She just left<LINE>
//with her mother in a taxi.<LINE>
//Yoshiko is leaving today<LINE>
//for the United States.<END>

//Fujisawa!<LINE>
//Fujisawa!...<END>

//Oh, darn!<END>

//Yoshiko, hurry up!<END>

//Yes.<END>

//...<END>

//Yoshiko, do you have your passport?<LINE>
//Yoshiko?<END>

//Ma-Matsuyama...<END>

//Fujisawa, I made it in time.<END>

//Why are you here, Matsuyama?<END>

//Your leg is bleeding, Matsuyama!<END>

//What?<END>

//Wait a second...<END>

//Oh, don't worry.<LINE>
//Your handkerchief is going<LINE>
//to be stained with blood.<END>

//No, you're not bleeding much...<END>

//Congratulations on your victory, Matsuyama.<END>

//Oh, thank you.<LINE>
//We were able to win thanks to the headbands<LINE>
//that you made for us.<END>

//Sorry for leaving without saying anything.<END>

//No problem.<LINE>
//You had your own reasons.<END>

//You know, this is the last time<LINE>
//that you will take care of my injuries.<END>

//Matsuyama, you always play<LINE>
//so dangerously.<LINE>
//No one gets injured as much as you do...<END>

//Heheheâ€¦<LINE>
//You should say that I play<LINE>
//with dynamism instead!<END>

//Keep the pressure up there,<LINE>
//for a while...<END>

//Thank you, Fujisawa.<END>

//...<END>

//What's wrong?<END>

//You came so suddenly...<END>

//Hey, don't cry...<END>

//Matsuyama!<END>

//Take care of yourself...<LINE>
//Write to me and I will reply...<END>

//Yes.<END>

//And I will keep this headband<LINE>
//to remember you.<LINE>
//Thank you.<END>

//Thank you...<END>
