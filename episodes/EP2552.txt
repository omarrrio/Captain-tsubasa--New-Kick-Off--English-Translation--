//Stop him! Form a wall!<LINE>
//Don't let him shoot!<END>

//Toho is trying to prevent a goal<LINE>
//by forming a wall in front of Tsubasa!<END>

//Come on, Tsubasa!<LINE>
//Show me your Drive Shot!<LINE>
//I found a way to stop it!<END>

//For a regular shot, the goalkeeper<LINE>
//must come out to reduce the angle towards<LINE>
//which the ball should head.<LINE>
//But for the Drive Shot,<LINE>
//you have to do the opposite...<END>

//If I come out, the ball will pass<LINE>
//over my head.<LINE>
//Even if I react quickly,<LINE>
//I won't be able to reach it!<END>

//To stop a Drive Shot,<LINE>
//I must stay in front of the goal<LINE>
//and catch the ball<LINE>
//as it descends!<END>

//This is it! Drive Shot!<LINE>
//We have to break through that wall!<END>

//There it is!<LINE>
//Tsubasa unleashes his ultimate shot,<LINE>
//the Drive Shot!<END>

//I, Ken Wakashimazu, swear that I will stop<LINE>
//this Drive Shot!<END>

//Tsubasa always shoots to the left<LINE>
//or to the right,<LINE>
//either one side or the other.<END>

//I'll first stand<LINE>
//in front of the goal line,<LINE>
//then react quickly<LINE>
//according to his angle of shot!<END>

//Wakashimazu doesn't come out of the goal<LINE>
//and chooses to stay<LINE>
//in front of the goal line!<END>

//All I have to do now is<LINE>
//react quickly<LINE>
//when he shoots!<END>

//Ragh!<END>

//Wakashimazu jumps to reach the ball!<END>

//Now he's gauging the time<LINE>
//as the ball descends!<LINE>
//It seems he's thought this move over<LINE>
//after the first Drive Shot!<END>

//Oh! He... He stopped it!<END>

//The goalkeeper, Wakashimazu,<LINE>
//catches the ball with one hand<LINE>
//in front of the goal line!<LINE>
//The Drive Shot has been defeated!<END>

//What!<END>

//Wakashimazu!<END>

//No! Wait a... Minute!<END>

//Tsubasa's Drive Shot<LINE>
//wasn't stopped,<LINE>
//as the ball keeps spinning,<LINE>
//carried by the power of the shot!<END>

//The goalkeeper, Wakashimazu,<LINE>
//is carried away by the ball!<END>

//Darn! I thought I had stopped it!<END>

//You were close, Wakashimazu.<LINE>
//Your tactics for stopping the Drive Shot<LINE>
//are correct.<END>

//Captain!<END>

//You were the first to react<LINE>
//to that shot and catch<LINE>
//the ball. Have faith in yourself!<END>

//Okay!<END>

//Tsubasa!<LINE>
//Count on me to stop it<LINE>
//next time!<END>

//Wakashimazu may be capable<LINE>
//of stopping Tsubasa's Drive Shot.<END>

//But nobody has ever succeeded<LINE>
//in blocking my Tiger Shot!<LINE>
//All I have to do is retrieve the ball<LINE>
//and score!<END>
