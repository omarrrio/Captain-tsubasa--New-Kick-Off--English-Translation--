//Oh? The giant Daimaru has just entered<LINE>
//the field in the second half<LINE>
//and already Hanawa passes him the ball.<END>

//OK, let's take the ball from them!<LINE>
//No way we're letting them attack!<END>

//The explosive power of my kicks<LINE>
//is the only reason they let me play.<END>

//What? Daimaru kicks the<LINE>
//ball from the middle of the field<LINE>
//with extraordinary force!<LINE>
//The ball flies towards Nankatsu's goal!<END>

//What?!<END>

//Is this a joke?<END>

//This is it, Kazuo!<END>

//OK!<END>

//The second half has barely started<LINE>
//and Nankatsu is already in trouble!<END>

//Alright! We have to jump!<LINE>
//We jump and block!<LINE>
//It's the only solution!<END>

//Tsubasa runs towards his own goalposts!<END>

//Hey hey, Tsubasa.<LINE>
//Sorry, but you're jumping for nothing this time.<END>

//Hanawa tries a Skylab Hurricane,<LINE>
//but this time with Kazuo underneath!<END>

//And here comes the Tachibana brothers'<LINE>
//Skylab Hurricane!<END>

//Got it!<END>

//Yeah, I'm Tsubasa!<LINE>
//Even alone,<LINE>
//I can reach the heavens!<END>

//Ah! Tsubasa jumps!<LINE>
//But this time, he's actually using<LINE>
//the crossbar for support,<LINE>
//not the post!<END>

//What?!<END>

//The two players are in the air.<LINE>
//Ozora rises... And it's a collision!<LINE>
//Tsubasa has blocked the Skylab Hurricane!<LINE>
//An incredible defensive technique against<LINE>
//the Tachibana brothers' new technique!<END>

//But they're in danger!<LINE>
//The two players have lost their balance<LINE>
//and are falling towards the ground!<END>

//Oh no! Look out!<END>

//Masao!<END>

//No!<END>

//He's going to land on his head...<END>

//The two players have flipped over<LINE>
//and crashed to the ground!<END>

//Tsubasa!<END>

//It looks like Tsubasa landed first<LINE>
//and got hurt badly!<END>

//My... Shoulder...<END>

//Are you okay, Masao?<END>

//Tsubasa cushioned my fall.<END>

//What?<END>

//It could be serious, you might<LINE>
//have dislocated your shoulder.<LINE>
//Go to the infirmary right away!<END>

//I'm fine...<LINE>
//I can keep playing.<END>

//Tsubasa, you don't look good at all.<LINE>
//You look really pale.<LINE>
//You need to get checked out!<END>

//He's right.<LINE>
//We'll continue without you.<END>

//Go to the infirmary immediately.<LINE>
//That's an order.<LINE>
//If you don't listen to me,<LINE>
//I'll make you leave.<END>

//Okay... I understand.<END>

//Sorry, friends.<LINE>
//I'll be back soon.<LINE>
//I'm counting on you while I'm gone.<END>
