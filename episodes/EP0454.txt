//Let's go, Kazuo!<END>

//Shall we do it again, Masao?<END>

//Do you still have some techniques<LINE>
//up your sleeve?<END>

//Masao passes the ball forward.<LINE>
//And Kazuo runs towards it!<LINE>
//What's happening?<END>

//Now that Misaki's not here anymore,<LINE>
//we are the best duo in Japan!<LINE>
//And this match is proof of that!<END>

//Your duo techniques during<LINE>
//the national tournament were<LINE>
//just luck.<LINE>
//But we're different.<LINE>
//We are a real duo...<END>

//Here we go! Twin Shot!<END>

//What... What is that?<END>

//Ah! The Tachibana brothers<LINE>
//are going to shoot simultaneously!<END>

//Ah! The ball is moving towards the goal<LINE>
//in a wave-like pattern!<END>

//Morisaki!<END>

//In the end, it's just a ball<LINE>
//no matter what kind of effect it has.<LINE>
//And the ball is my friend.<LINE>
//Even if I take it right in the face!<END>

//Come on, there's got to be<LINE>
//some part of my body<LINE>
//that will touch it!<END>

//Goalkeeper Morisaki uses his entire body<LINE>
//to block the ball!<END>

//The ball hits Morisaki's shoulder!<END>

//But the impact just deflects the ball<LINE>
//and it's still moving towards the goal!<END>

//No! If we get scored on now,<LINE>
//it's over!<END>

//Ah!<END>

//Ishizaki suddenly jumps<LINE>
//in front of the ball's trajectory!<END>

//Oh! He blocks it with his face!<LINE>
//Well done, Ishizaki!<LINE>
//Nankatsu is really ready to do anything<LINE>
//to defend its goal!<LINE>
//Hanawa didn't score!<END>

//But Ishizaki is carried<LINE>
//forward by his momentum<LINE>
//and hits the goalpost!<END>

//Ishizaki!<END>

//I'm okay!<LINE>
//Hurry up and counterattack, Tsubasa!<LINE>
//All our opponents are in attack,<LINE>
//their defense is weakened!<END>
