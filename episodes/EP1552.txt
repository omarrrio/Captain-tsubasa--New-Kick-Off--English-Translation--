//What?!<END>

//Ah!<END>

//He's taken out Kaltz and Schester!<END>

//Two down!<END>

//Oh, it's a foul on Tsubasa by Germany!<LINE>
//That tackle wasn't even aimed at the ball and<LINE>
//took down Tsubasa!<END>

//You okay, Tsubasa?<END>

//Yeah...I'm used to this kind of play now.<LINE>
//I'm not going to let them get the better of me!<END>

//It's a free kick for Japan.<END>

//Germany is setting up their wall…<LINE>
//Huh? Muller is having the wall taken down!<END>

//I don't need a wall, it just blocks my view.<END>

//Ugh...He's mocking us!<END>

//But we don't stand a chance of scoring from<LINE>
//here against a goalkeeper like him...He<LINE>
//doesn't have any weaknesses. What can we do...<END>

//Tsubasa! He just kindly removed the wall<LINE>
//for us...All you have to do is shoot with<LINE>
//all your might!<END>

//You're right, Hyuga...<END>

//Wait!<END>

//What?<END>

//Oh! It looks like Tsubasa whispered<LINE>
//something to Hyuga.<END>

//Okay.<END>

//Good.<END>

//Who will take the free kick? Tsubasa or<LINE>
//Hyuga? Or will they fake a pass?<END>

//Ready?<END>

//Here we go!<END>

//Both players move forward at the same time!<LINE>
//Is it to surprise the goalkeeper?<LINE>
//Will we see a Tiger shot<LINE>
//or a Drive shot?<END>

//That won't work on me!<LINE>
//I'll stop any shot!<END>

//Go!<END>

//Ah! Tsubasa tackles the ball<LINE>
//and sends it forward!<END>

//It looks like Japan is determined<LINE>
//to shoot from closer!<END>

//It's still too far away…<LINE>
//Where should I aim<LINE>
//to score against this goalkeeper?<END>

//I have to trust<LINE>
//my instincts as a scorer!<END>

//There!<END>

//He shoots it right at the goalkeeper!<END>

//Huh?<END>

//Did it go in?<END>

//Muller is surprised by this ball<LINE>
//flying straight at him. Will he be able<LINE>
//to stop it? Ah! He manages to stop it<LINE>
//by kneeling down!<END>

//Impossible...<END>

//It's not a goal, but...<END>

//Hyuga's Neo Tiger Shot really put<LINE>
//Muller to the test!<END>

//Tsubasa, it's just a hunch,<LINE>
//but maybe if we shoot<LINE>
//between his legs, it might work...<END>

//!!!<END>

//*Whistle blows*<END>
