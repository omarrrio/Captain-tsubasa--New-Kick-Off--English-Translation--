//Manager! Can you please refill us?<LINE>
//Please?<END>

//Yes!<END>

//An energy drink with milk<LINE>
//and Hokkaido honey.<END>

//Finish your drink and come on everyone!<END>

//Here you go.<END>

//As we're not used to<LINE>
//this hot and humid weather,<LINE>
//we have to be careful not to exhaust<LINE>
//our energy during the match.<END>

//It should be fine, coach.<LINE>
//So far, no one has been affected<LINE>
//and we all have plenty of energy to spare.<LINE>
//We can play very well today.<LINE>
//Don't worry!<END>

//Yeah, I guess you're right.<END>

//Guys, don't let your guard down.<LINE>
//The further you progress in the championship,<LINE>
//the stronger your opponents will be.<END>

//Today's opponent, Minamiuwa, has<LINE>
//a team whose defense and attack<LINE>
//are well-balanced.<LINE>
//Beware of captain Ishida<LINE>
//and the forward Takei's heading game.<END>

//Yes, coach!<END>

//If we win today,<LINE>
//we'll be able to face Nankatsu,<LINE>
//which remains our top goal.<END>

//For that, we have to beat Minamiuwa<LINE>
//without any effort!<END>

//Yes!<END>

//And our second goal<LINE>
//is to beat Hyuga in the final!<END>

//Yoshiko.<END>

//But...<END>

//It's okay, Yoshiko?<END>

//As I promised you,<LINE>
//as long as your football team wins,<LINE>
//you can stay in Japan.<END>

//Which means that if Furano lost<LINE>
//today, we would leave immediately.<END>

//...Okay.<END>

//This can't be true...<END>

//Matsuyama, do you have a moment?<END>

//What's up?<END>

//Yoshiko...<END>

//...<END>

//Do you have something to tell me?<END>

//Go ahead, Yoshiko. Speak!<END>

//Um...<END>

//Huh?<END>

//Captain, what are you doing?<LINE>
//Hurry up!<END>

//OK.<END>

//So, manager?<END>

//Good... good luck!<LINE>
//Promise me you'll win this match.<END>

//Yes... Is that all?<END>

//Yes...<END>

//What was that about?<END>

//Come on, guys. Let's go!<END>

//Oh!<END>

//...<END>

//But it doesn't matter...<END>

//Because at the moment, Matsuyama<LINE>
//is thinking of nothing else but winning<LINE>
//the match.<END>

//Let's go, Furano!<LINE>
//Go Furano!<END>

//Here we go!<END>

//As usual, they enter<LINE>
//the field shouting to motivate themselves!<LINE>
//Representing Hokkaido, the Furano 11!<END>

//In contrast, Minamiuwa enters<LINE>
//the field calm and focused.<END>

//They must defeat Furano to advance<LINE>
//to the semi-finals and face Nankatsu,<LINE>
//the reigning champions.<END>

//Furano advances thanks to their teamwork.<LINE>
//To what extent can their opponents<LINE>
//make them suffer?<LINE>
//This is Minamiuwa's first appearance<LINE>
//in the tournament!<END>

//The referee blows the whistle<LINE>
//to start the match.<END>
