//Oh, while Sano keeps the ball,<LINE>
//Jito makes a cross run<LINE>
//from the opposite wing!<END>

//Guys, Jito is moving up the field!<END>

//What?<END>

//Heh heh heh, do you really <LINE>
//want to leave me all alone?<LINE>
//It's me who has the ball,<LINE>
//have you forgotten?<END>

//Sano is running just in front of the goal,<LINE>

//Watch out! Don't let him shoot!<END>

//Hmm...I think I'll pass instead.<END>

//What?<END>

//Sano decided to make a pass!<LINE>
//He's having fun with the<LINE>
//champions of Nankatsu!<END>

//But Jito is not as free<LINE>
//in his movements. He's marked by Oda.<END>

//Don't you understand?<LINE>
//You can come as much as you want,<LINE>
//it won't change anything!<END>

//What? Despite being marked,<LINE>
//Jito shoots with force!<END>

//However, this time<LINE>
//it's not a long-distance shot,<LINE>
//but a full-power shot<LINE>
//from point-blank range!<LINE>
//Will Morisaki be able to stop it?<END>

//!!<END>

//He...He got it!<LINE>
//Morisaki placed himself right in<LINE>
//front of the ball to stop it!<END>

//Well done, Morisaki!<END>

//Argh...<END>

//What?<END>

//Mo...Morisaki!<END>

//No! It looks like the goalkeeper fell<LINE>
//into the goal with the ball!<LINE>
//What incredible power!<END>
