//After the national championship, the selected players<LINE>
//trained in preparation for the European tour.<END>

//Tsubasa Ozora, the captain of Nankatsu<LINE>
//Junior High and the winner of the national championship,<LINE>
//had to resign himself to not participating in the European tour<LINE>
//due to the injury he sustained during the championship.<END>

//Hey, it's Tsubasa!<END>

//Hi Ishizaki, hi everyone.<END>

//How's your injury doing?<END>

//It's almost healed.<LINE>
//But the doctor still won't let me train.<END>

//I see...<END>

//As I couldn't stand being away from the field<LINE>
//anymore, I came to watch the training as a spectator.<END>

//You're obviously welcome, but<LINE>
//don't you think that watching us will just make you<LINE>
//want to play even more?<END>

//Hmm... I hadn't thought about that!<END>

//You'll never change!<END>

//Ha ha ha ha!<END>

//Well, since Tsubasa is here...<LINE>
//Misugi, why don't you give him<LINE>
//what we talked about earlier?<END>

//Oh, yeah!<END>

//Huh?<END>

//Here's the All Japan Jr. Youth Team jersey...<END>

//We were free to choose any number,<LINE>
//but no one wanted number 10.<END>

//But... I'm not even going to participate<LINE>
//in the training camp.<END>

//Plus, Hyuga and Matsuyama usually wear<LINE>
//number 10...<END>

//Don't worry. The number 10 of All Japan<LINE>
//is yours.<END>

//Yes.<END>

//Hyuga...<END>

//Tsubasa, you're the only one who deserves to wear<LINE>
//this number.<END>

//You... all of you...<END>

//Ah...<END>

//Tsubasa?<END>

//I really want to go to the European tour!<END>

//Even if you don't have the opportunity to wear<LINE>
//this jersey this time, you'll surely wear it<LINE>
//next time...<END>

//Today marks the end of the training camp.<LINE>
//I will now announce the list of 17 players selected for the<LINE>
//European tour!<END>

//!!!<END>

//...<END>

//Nothing is easy in football...<END>

//Out of the 24 players selected for the national team,<LINE>
//only 17 remain as starters. And in the end, only 11 of<LINE>
//these 17 players will be on the field.<END>

//Football is really a very tough sport.<END>

//Tsubasa, I have a message from Katagiri for you. He's waiting to<LINE>
//see you completely recovered and in good shape for the 1st Annual<LINE>
//French International Jr. Youth Tournament.<END>

//The All Japan Jr. Youth Team cannot do without the golden<LINE>
//pair formed by Tsubasa Ozora and Taro Misaki.<END>

//What! Misaki was selected?<END>

//Two days later,<LINE>
//the All Japan Jr. Youth Team took off<LINE>
//for Germany, the first stop on the European tour!<END>
