//Tsubasa is going to shoot a Drive shoot!<END>

//Even with a leg and a shoulder injured,<LINE>
//I will succeed in this Drive shoot!<END>

//Is that what he's going to do?<LINE>
//Damn, if we can't counter<LINE>
//his Drive shoot, we are no longer<LINE>
//certain to win the match!<END>

//Here we go, Drive shoot!<END>

//Despite his injuries, Tsubasa shoots!<LINE>
//It looks like he doesn't see anything else<LINE>
//but the ball and the opposing goal!<END>

//What?<LINE>
//Sano throws himself in the path of the shot!<END>

//But Sano is ejected into the air!<END>

//Sano!<END>

//Sano's body stopped Tsubasa's Drive shoot!<END>

//But Tsubasa doesn't waste any time<LINE>
//and rushes towards the ball!<END>

//The ball is still in play!<END>

//Tsubasa, the captain of Nankatsu, charges<LINE>
//towards the opposing goal<LINE>
//with astonishing tenacity<LINE>
//during this second half!<END>

//Grrr…<LINE>
//Sano, your defense was not in vain!<END>

//And Tsubasa attempts a Drive shoot!<END>

//But Jito attempts the same defensive move<LINE>
//as Sano, and rushes to block<LINE>
//the ball with his body!<END>

//Argh!<END>

//Hirado's resistance is incredible!<LINE>
//They don't allow a single goal to get in!<END>

//Jito's giant body was also<LINE>
//thrown by the impact!<LINE>
//Tsubasa's Drive shoot is really<LINE>
//diabolically powerful!<END>

//And Tsubasa rushes again<LINE>
//towards the ball that has<LINE>
//fallen to the ground!<LINE>
//It's simply incredible!<END>

//Not yet…<LINE>
//You haven't yet defended against<LINE>
//my Drive shoot!<LINE>
//Roberto's Drive shoot is invincible!<END>

//He is completely focused on the goal!<LINE>
//And on victory!<LINE>
//For a third consecutive victory<LINE>
//in the national tournament!<END>

//Ah!<END>

//Don't imagine that we're going to let<LINE>
//the ball pass!<END>

//Oh! Jito immediately gets up<LINE>
//after taking Tsubasa's Drive shoot<LINE>
//in full force!<END>

//Wow!<END>

//And he's going to block it again!<LINE>
//What an extraordinary defense!<END>

//And once again, he is struck<LINE>
//by Tsubasa's Drive shoot!<END>

//But...What is this...<LINE>
//Goaaal!<END>

//In trying to block the Drive shoot,<LINE>
//Jito was pushed behind<LINE>
//his own goal line!<END>

//What a mistake...<END>

//Tsubasa's determination was stronger<LINE>
//than that of his opponents!<LINE>
//And his Drive shoot was fabulous!<END>
