//Oh no!<END>

//Very good!<END>

//Misugi makes a short pass<LINE>
//towards the goal.<LINE>
//Will we witness a one-two<LINE>
//by the attackers?<END>

//Here we go!<END>

//No! Honma opts for a long pass!<END>

//The ball passes just behind<LINE>
//Wakashimazu! The tall Sanada<LINE>
//rushes towards it!<END>

//You're done for!<END>

//Not yet!<END>

//What?!<END>

//Oh, it's missed!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu hurries back<LINE>
//and clears the ball!<END>

//This should do it!<END>

//And Misugi runs after the ball<LINE>
//sent back by Wakashimazu!<END>

//What?!<END>

//I have to take my chance<LINE>
//with a volley<LINE>
//before Sawada catches it!<LINE>
//I have no choice...<END>

//I have to make it!<END>

//Wow! Misugi lifts the ball<LINE>
//in the middle of the run and prepares<LINE>
//to make an acrobatic overhead kick!<END>

//The goalkeeper, Wakashimazu,<LINE>
//has still not returned to his position!<LINE>
//He has just been caught off guard!<END>

//Do you really think I'm going to let you<LINE>
//score another goal?<END>

//Seriously?<END>

//Come on, right in the goal!<END>

//Wakashimazu dives out of the goal<LINE>
//as usual!<LINE>
//Will he make it?<END>

//He fails! Another goal for Musashi!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu has just let<LINE>
//two goals in!<END>

//Grrr!<END>

//Two goals...<END>

//What a fantastic bicycle kick<LINE>
//by Misugi, and what a superb control<LINE>
//to send the ball<LINE>
//into the top right corner of the goal!<END>

//That's the job done!<END>
