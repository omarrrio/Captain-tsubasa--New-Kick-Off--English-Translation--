//Matsuyama is now getting closer to Sawada<LINE>
//to take the ball from him!<END>

//Matsuyama is hard to beat<LINE>

//I should let him have the ball!<LINE>
//I need to pass to Hyuga!<END>

//One more goal, just one more goal<LINE>
//and we can win!<LINE>
//I have to score!<END>

//What?<END>

//Let's go, guys!<LINE>
//We can still get one more!<END>

//Furano rushes towards Toho!<LINE>
//Can Toho block this attack?<END>

//It's a fast pass!<LINE>
//Block the ball!<END>

//Toho's players are spreading out<LINE>

//with a similar shot!<LINE>
//I'll block it!<END>

//Wakashimazu dives to the side<LINE>
//to stop the shot!<LINE>
//Will he succeed?<END>

//What?<END>
