//they also have an excellent team game.<END>

//But when it comes to team play,<LINE>
//no team can compare<LINE>
//to Furano!<END>

//Matsuyama and Furano need to<LINE>

//Alright, guys, come over here!<END>

//Yes, coach!<END>

//Today's match could very well be<LINE>
//the toughest one for you.<LINE>
//Don't think about tomorrow,<LINE>
//but focus on this match.<END>

//Yes, coach!<END>

//Nankatsu is a tough opponent...<LINE>
//And even if Tsubasa Ozora is injured,<LINE>
//he is still a key player.<END>

//If you can stop Tsubasa,<LINE>
//everything will be fine for us.<LINE>
//For that, I'm counting on you, Matsuyama,<LINE>
//to mark him very closely.<END>

//Yes, count on me.<END>

//Good!<LINE>
//Don't forget your energy drink,<LINE>
//and let's get to work!<END>

//Yes, coach!<END>

//Manager?<END>

//Yoshiko...<END>

//But...<END>

//What is it, Manager?<END>

//Yoshiko made headbands<LINE>
//for the team.<END>

//Headbands?<END>

//But, no one wears them<LINE>
//on the other teams...<END>

//Let me see.<END>

//Oh...<END>

//You must have worked hard<LINE>
//to make all this.<END>

//By the way, Fujisawa,<LINE>
//are you still going<LINE>
//to the United States<LINE>
//in the second semester?<END>

//Yes.<END>

//Oh, okay... ?<END>

//...<END>

//Since Fujisawa went to so much trouble<LINE>
//to make these headbands,<LINE>
//we're all going to wear them on the field!<END>

//Okay!<END>

//We'll be more recognizable this way,<LINE>
//hahaha!<END>

//Matsuyama...<END>

//Yoshiko embroidered each of our numbers.<END>

//Is this mine?<END>

//Yes, Matsuyama.<END>

//Oh, thank you!<END>

//Great!<END>

//Please, Matsuyama,<LINE>
//win the game...<END>

//And to the cheers of the crowd<LINE>
//both teams step<LINE>
//onto the field!<END>

//It looks like all the Furano players<LINE>
//are wearing headbands!<LINE>
//They'll need a lot of determination<LINE>
//to beat Nankatsu today!<END>

//Even though you're injured,<LINE>
//I won't go easy on you, Tsubasa!<END>

//Just two more games!<LINE>
//We're going to win!<LINE>
//I can't lose in Japan!<END>

//Tsubasa, Furano has worked hard<LINE>
//waiting for this day.<LINE>
//We will achieve our goal<LINE>
//and beat Nankatsu!<END>

//Matsuyama, I won't lose this match!<END>

//Second semifinal,<LINE>
//Nankatsu vs. Furano.<LINE>
//The two captains shake hands<LINE>
//before taking their positions<LINE>
//on the field.<END>

//Which team will play in the final?<LINE>
//Furano, with their excellent teamwork,<LINE>
//or Nankatsu with their perfectly balanced<LINE>
//game?<END>

//The referee has blown the whistle<LINE>
//and the match has begun!<LINE>
//The semifinal has started!<END>
