//Misaki makes a pass towards Hyuga<LINE>
//in front of the goal!<END>

//Kojiro!<END>

//N-no!<END>

//It's good! I'm going to score the<LINE>
//winning goal!<END>

//What?!<END>

//Oh no! The ball is stopped<LINE>
//by a puddle of water!<LINE>
//Hyuga won't be able to shoot!<END>

//What luck for France!<END>

//Phew, we dodged a bullet.<END>

//Napoleon recovers the ball.<END>

//Pierre, it's our turn!<LINE>
//The football gods are with us!<END>

//Napoleon!<END>

//Here comes the Eiffel Attack!<END>

//The Eiffel Attack? Is that some sort<LINE>
//of aerial technique like ours?<END>

//No, it doesn't seem like it!<END>

//France charges towards the Japanese goal<LINE>
//with an impressive passing game!<END>

//It's a series of one-two passes<LINE>
//between Napoleon and Pierre!<END>

//This passing game is built on the<LINE>
//architectural model of the Eiffel Tower,<LINE>
//which is why it's called the Eiffel Attack.<END>

//We need to get in their way!<END>

//We need to intercept the pass!<END>

//Impressive!<LINE>
//Pierre makes a high pass<LINE>
//that goes over the defender's head!<LINE>
//It's clear that just getting in their way<LINE>
//isn't enough!<END>

//The distance between their passes is getting closer.<END>

//I have to stop them!<END>

//There!<END>

//Misaki makes a tackle just as<LINE>
//Pierre receives the ball from Napoleon.<END>

//Oh! Pierre takes the ball with his left<LINE>
//foot instead of his right!<LINE>
//Misaki misses his tackle!<END>

//The passing game has now reached<LINE>
//the top of this imaginary tower!<LINE>
//We are witnessing a game of short passes<LINE>
//between the two players!<END>

//Only Misugi remains in defense!<END>

//I told Tsubasa that I would take care<LINE>
//of the defense! I have to stop them!<END>

//Misugi charges at Pierre!<END>

//Both players touch the ball<LINE>
//at the same time!<LINE>
//The ball is thrown up into the air!<END>

//Pierre returns the ball to Napoleon<LINE>
//with a superb header!<END>

//Rhaaa!<END>

//One-on-one!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu comes out of the goal without hesitation!<END>

//Napoleon, shoot!<END>

//Okay!<END>

//Napoleon is about to shoot,<LINE>
//but Wakashimazu dives onto the ball.<END>

//TÃ©gatana defense!<END>

//Arghhhhhh!<END>

//Napoleon strikes a powerful Cannon Shoot!<LINE>
//The ball is deflected by Wakashimazu,<LINE>
//but not enough and heads straight<LINE>
//toward the Japanese goal!<END>

//Ohhhhhhhh! Wakashimazu managed to deflect<LINE>
//the ball onto the crossbar!<END>

//I'm going to score!<LINE>
//The Eiffel Attack is unstoppable!<END>

//Oh! The ball is still in play<LINE>
//and Pierre takes it back with a magnificent<LINE>
//airborne volley!<END>

//Gooooooal!<LINE>
//The Japanese defense couldn't withstand<LINE>
//the Eiffel Attack!<END>

//Yes!<END>
