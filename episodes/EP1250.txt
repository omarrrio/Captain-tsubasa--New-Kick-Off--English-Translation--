//Oh! He got tackled from behind!<LINE>
//Foul! The referee is asking<LINE>
//Italy to calm down.<END>

//We've got our chance, guys.<LINE>
//I can score directly from here!<END>

//Really? You mean you can make<LINE>

//Japan gets a direct free kick<LINE>

//Tsubasa is running! He's about to shoot!<END>

//We jump! We can't let the ball<LINE>

//Aah! It's a feint! It's not<LINE>
//Tsubasa, but Matsuyama<LINE>
//who's going to shoot!<END>

//I'm going to score!<END>

//Matsuyama unleashes his Eagle Shot!<LINE>
//The ball skims across<LINE>
//the ground towards the goal!<END>

//This can't be!<END>

//Ohhh! Stopped by the Italian goalkeeper!<END>

//What a reflex save! What a grip!<LINE>
//Matsuyama's powerful Eagle Shot<LINE>
//was stopped with one hand!<END>

//Gino Hernandez once again proves<LINE>
//with this save that he's<LINE>
//the best goalkeeper in Europe!<END>
