//Tsubasa is about to shoot!<END>

//But the striker Schneider<LINE>
//has already returned!<END>

//He must have realized what was happening<LINE>
//and has come back to defend!<END>

//Tsubasa is going for the shot!<LINE>
//It's a duel between the two captains!<END>

//Neither player seems willing<LINE>
//to give up!<END>

//We can see the intensity of the collision<LINE>
//between these two players when we see<LINE>
//how fast the ball is spinning!<END>

//Oh, but Kaltz comes from behind<LINE>
//and takes the ball!<END>

//What?<END>

//But he loses control of it<LINE>
//because of its spin!<END>

//The ball is my friend!<END>

//Tsubasa recovers the ball.<LINE>
//It's literally glued to his foot!<END>

//Look, Roberto! I'm going to score!<END>

//No!<END>

//Tsubasa is about to shoot!<END>

//Aaah!<END>

//Whatever happens<LINE>
//I won't let you score!<END>

//Argh! My foot...I must have injured it<LINE>
//during the collision with Schneider<LINE>
//earlier!<END>

//My shot might not be<LINE>
//powerful enough...<END>

//Muller comes out of his goal! But why<LINE>
//isn't Tsubasa shooting?<END>

//Oh! Tsubasa is finally shooting!<END>

//What?!<END>

//Wait, that's not a shot!<END>

//The ball is like glued to his foot.<LINE>
//It rotates backwards,<LINE>
//then he passes the ball backwards!<LINE>
//It's impressive!<END>

//Your turn, Hyuga!<END>

//Japan's star striker,<LINE>
//Kojiro Hyuga, is receiving it!<END>

//You'll see!<END>

//I can't waste this opportunity!<LINE>
//I'm going to shoot a Neo Tiger Shot!<END>

//I'm going to shoot with all my might!<END>

//I won't let you score!<END>

//Schneider, you'd better<LINE>
//not get in my way,<LINE>
//or you're going to get hurt!<END>

//Ah...my foot...<END>

//Neo Tiger Shot!<END>

//Hyuga's shot goes through<LINE>
//Schneider's defense!<END>

//Aaaah!<END>

//Goooooal!<END>

//Mueller was about to stop<LINE>
//the ball, but he couldn't hold it<LINE>
//for very long! Hyuga's Neo Tiger Shot<LINE>
//goes straight into the goal!<END>

//Great shot, Hyuga!<END>

//I did it!<END>

//It's for moments like these<LINE>
//that I'm on the field!<END>
