//Schester shoots!<END>

//I'm going to score!<END>

//Wakabayashi dives just in time!<END>

//Ohhhh! Wakabayashi doesn't stop the ball,<LINE>
//but clears it directly!<END>

//Go!<END>

//Hyuga, it's your turn!<END>

//Count on me!<END>

//Tsubasa runs towards the goal<LINE>
//and Sawada takes the position<LINE>
//left vacant by Tsubasa!<END>

//Do you know what to do, Takeshi?<END>

//Yes!<END>

//This time, Hyuga and Sawada both shoot<LINE>
//at the same time towards the incoming ball<LINE>
//from behind!<END>

//It's a volley<LINE>
//combined with a bicycle kick!<END>

//It won't work with me!<END>

//The ball wobbles in the air!<END>

//I'll easily stop that...<END>

//Huh?<END>

//What? The ball has deviated from its course!<END>

//How?!<END>

//It wasn't a shot on goal,<LINE>
//but a pass! The ball is moving away<LINE>
//from the goal!<END>

//It's thanks to the difference<LINE>
//in power between my shot and Hyuga's<LINE>
//that the ball deviates like this!<END>

//Misaki is running towards the goal! This pass was<LINE>
//meant for him!<END>

//It's my turn to play!<END>

//Misaki's superb diving header!<END>

//Aaah!<END>

//But Muller anticipated the move<LINE>
//and stretched out his arm to stop it!<END>

//Misaki, hold on! I'm coming!<END>

//Tsubasa!<END>

//Misaki!<END>

//What?!<END>

//Ahhhh! But what... ?<LINE>
//Tsubasa jumped with both feet in front<LINE>
//of Misaki's back!<END>

//Mueller is defeated!<END>

//We did it!<END>

//The ball passed the goal line<LINE>
//with Misaki!<LINE>
//It's Nankatsu's golden pair!...<LINE>
//No, it's Japan's!<END>
