//What's happening?<LINE>
//Usually, at the end of the match,<LINE>
//Tsubasa leads the attack.<END>

//But Tsubasa is holding back<LINE>
//and he's facing the goal!<LINE>
//Is he exhausted?<END>

//Well, no! Here he is back!<END>

//It's like in the national championship<LINE>
//when we were in elementary school!<END>

//Even a tenth of a second<LINE>
//before the final whistle,<LINE>
//Tsubasa never gives up!<LINE>
//He's cooking up something!<END>

//But that's not possible!<END>

//The match has resumed! The ball is<LINE>
//in the center circle<LINE>
//and passes from Kisugi to Taki.<END>

//Taki passes back!<END>

//I was sure! I wasn't wrong!<END>

//I'll take care of it!<END>

//Nankatsu and Tsubasa have turned<LINE>
//and run towards the ball!<END>

//What?<END>

//Matsuyama seems to have understood<LINE>
//and rushes towards Tsubasa!<END>

//Tsubasa!<LINE>
//You're not the type to give up!<LINE>
//Are you ready for the final battle?<END>

//Damn... This Matsuyama!<LINE>
//He reads every one of our movements!<LINE>
//But I won't give up! Never!<END>

//Grrr!<END>

//It's a terrifying clash<LINE>
//between the two players!<END>

//Oh no! Tsubasa's injured leg<LINE>
//seems to be causing him pain!<LINE>
//Tsubasa has been thrown to the ground!<END>

//Sorry Tsubasa, but I've decided<LINE>
//not to give you any gifts,<LINE>
//even if you're injured.<END>

//If I worry about your injury,<LINE>
//I'll lose.<LINE>
//Nankatsu is too strong an opponent!<END>

//Matsuyama erases the Nankatsu players<LINE>
//and prepares his shot!<END>

//Will he shoot from far away?<END>

//Take that, Nankatsu!<LINE>
//We'll show you what Furano's<LINE>
//tenacity is all about!<END>

//Ah! Morisaki didn't react fast enough!<END>

//Matsuyama's powerful shot has entered<LINE>
//Nankatsu's goal!<LINE>
//Furano is leading!<END>
