//Stop them! Form a wall!<LINE>
//Don't let them shoot!<END>

//Toho tries to prevent a goal<LINE>
//by building a wall<LINE>
//in the path of Tsubasa.<END>

//Go, Tsubasa! Shoot your Drive Shoot!<LINE>
//I've figured out how to stop it!<END>

//For an ordinary shot,<LINE>
//the goalkeeper must move forward<LINE>
//to reduce the possible shooting angle, but<LINE>
//for the Drive Shoot, it's the opposite...<END>

//To stop the Drive Shoot,<LINE>
//I'll stay right in front of the goal line<LINE>
//and catch the ball<LINE>
//at the moment of its descent.<END>

//Come on, Drive Shoot! Break this wall!<END>

//There it is!<LINE>
//The super shot of Tsubasa, the Drive Shoot!<END>

//I, Ken Wakashimazu, will stop<LINE>
//the Drive Shoot!<END>

//Wakashimazu does not move forward.<LINE>
//On the contrary,<LINE>
//he waits on the goal line, ready to<LINE>
//stop the ball!<END>

//Argh!<END>

//He... He stopped it!<END>

//Wakashimazu caught the ball<LINE>
//with one hand,<LINE>
//right on the goal line!<LINE>
//He... He defeated the Drive Shoot!<END>

//How?<END>

//!!<END>

//Oh! Wait!<END>

//We thought he had stopped<LINE>
//Tsubasa's Drive Shoot,<LINE>
//but the ball had not lost<LINE>
//its power or speed<LINE>
//of rotation...<END>

//What? Wakashimazu!<END>

//Well, it seems that the match<LINE>
//is not yet over!<END>

//My Drive Shoot...<LINE>
//It's the first time<LINE>
//someone has reacted fast enough<LINE>
//to touch it.<LINE>
//Good job, Wakashimazu.<END>

//...thus repelling goalkeeper Wakashimazu!<END>
