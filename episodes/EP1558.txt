//We are the heirs of German football!<LINE>
//I must protect its values with this shot!<END>

//Schneider shoots!<END>

//You'll see!<END>

//Fireeeeeeeee!<END>

//I'm going to do it with mental strength!<LINE>
//This is my last Face Block<LINE>
//of the match!<END>

//Aaah! The shot has been blocked! Ishizaki<LINE>
//countered the Fire shot<LINE>
//with his Face Block!<END>

//This can't be!<END>

//But will Ishizaki recover<LINE>
//from Schneider's close-range Fire shot?<END>

//Urgh...<END>

//Ishizaki!<END>

//The ball is still in play!<LINE>
//I can't worry about my<LINE>
//opponents. I have to score!<END>

//Ishizaki's efforts will not be in vain!<LINE>
//I will stop Schneider!<END>

//I'll clear the ball<LINE>
//before you shoot!<END>

//Schneider!<END>

//What?!<END>

//Margas heads the ball<LINE>
//to Schneider who shoots directly!<END>

//Take that, Wakabayashi!<END>

//I'll stop it!<END>

//Tsubasa has returned to counter<LINE>
//Schneider's shot!<END>

//But he saw it coming, and instead of shooting,<LINE>
//lifts the ball into the air!<END>

//He dodges Tsubasa's tackle<LINE>
//and prepares to shoot again!<END>

//But Tsubasa doesn't give up<LINE>
//and jumps towards the ball!<LINE>
//Are we witnessing a Face Block<LINE>
//from Tsubasa?<END>

//What?!<END>

//It's a new feint<LINE>
//from Schneider!<END>

//He's waiting for the right moment to shoot...<LINE>
//Will he shoot with his left foot this time?<END>

//A left-footed strike? A feint?<LINE>
//What will he do?<END>

//No, Fire!<END>

//It's a left-footed strike!<LINE>
//The shot is curled, but Wakabayashi is<LINE>
//on the trajectory!<END>

//He fails to stop it!<LINE>
//It's a goooooal!<END>

//Schneider's shot crashes<LINE>
//into the back of the net!<LINE>
//Wakabayashi couldn't do anything!<END>

//Raaaah, I shouldn't have hesitated...<END>

//Ishizaki, are you okay?<END>

//Not really... I'm dizzy<LINE>
//and my nose won't stop bleeding...<END>

//You probably broke your nose...<END>

//It might be a concussion!<LINE>
//Lie down and don't move!<END>

//Damn... It was just my turn<LINE>
//to shine on the stage...<END>

//Tsubasa... Tsubasa, are you here?<END>

//Ishizaki... I'm here.<END>

//I wanted to thank you. It's thanks to you<LINE>
//that I was able to come this far.<END>

//Wakabayashi, you too, I'm sure you remember<LINE>
//how bad I was at soccer.<END>

//Since the day I met<LINE>
//Tsubasa, I knew how to improve my game<LINE>
//and become a starter for All Japan...<END>

//My only dream now is to see you<LINE>
//become the best player in the world,<LINE>
//Tsubasa. I know you will make it.<END>

//What are you talking about, Ishizaki?<LINE>
//It's not just me.<LINE>
//We all have to give our best<LINE>
//to improve ourselves!<END>

//You're right... But I don't think<LINE>
//I can do more than that...<END>

//Ishizaki...<END>

//Ishizaki, get up!<END>

//He has lost consciousness!<LINE>
//Bring the stretcher!<END>

//Ishizaki took Schneider's shot<LINE>
//right in the face, and now he's leaving<LINE>
//the field on a stretcher...<LINE>
//Let's hope it's nothing serious.<END>
