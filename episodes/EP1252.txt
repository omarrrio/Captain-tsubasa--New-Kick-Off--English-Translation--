//This is a pass to the two stars<LINE>
//of the All Japan Team, Tsubasa and Hyuga,<LINE>
//who are completely unmarked!<END>

//What's going on?<LINE>
//They're not even defending!<END>

//Only Hernandez remains in the way!<LINE>
//It's a golden opportunity<LINE>
//for the All Japan Team!<END>

//Our plan is working perfectly!<LINE>
//We're counting on you, Gino!<END>

//It's now or never!<END>

//Hernandez comes out without hesitation!<END>

//Tsubasa, I'll take care of him!<LINE>
//Be ready to take the ball!<END>

//Okay!<END>

//Hyuga jumps to take the ball!<END>

//Hernandez jumps too, at the edge<LINE>
//of the penalty area!<END>

//Oh my god!<END>

//Hyuga jumped the highest,<LINE>
//but Hernandez was able to grab<LINE>
//the ball with one hand!<END>

//Oh! Hernandez drops the ball!<END>

//It's my turn now!<END>

//Tsubasa rushes towards the ball!<END>

//I won't let you do that!<END>

//Oh! Hernandez hits the ball<LINE>
//before Tsubasa had a chance to shoot! What aerial play<LINE>
//from Hernandez!<END>

//Ah!<END>

//Hernandez stopped another scoring<LINE>
//chance for the All Japan Team!<END>

//Hernandez clears the ball far ahead!<END>

//Oh no!<END>

//Italy starts a counterattack!<END>

//It's as if they were all expecting<LINE>
//the ball to be cleared far ahead!<END>

//They planned this from the start!<END>

//The Italian passing game is lightning fast!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu comes out of his goal!<END>

//Raah!<END>

//But the Italians have a numerical advantage!<LINE>
//Conti finds himself alone in front of the goal<LINE>
//and shoots!<END>

//I've got it!<END>

//Aaah!<END>

//Goooal!<END>

//The Italy Jr. Youth Team scores<LINE>
//on a counterattack triggered<LINE>
//by their goalkeeper Hernandez!<END>

//Our plan is working perfectly.<END>

//This goal hurts the All Japan...<LINE>
//We'll see how their captain<LINE>
//Tsubasa Ozora will react!<END>
