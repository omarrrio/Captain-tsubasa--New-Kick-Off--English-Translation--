//This is a pass to the two stars<LINE>
//of the All Japan Team, Tsubasa and Hyuga,<LINE>
//who are completely unmarked!<END>

//What's happening?<LINE>
//They're not even defending!<END>

//Only Hernandez remains in their path!<LINE>
//This is a golden opportunity<LINE>
//for the All Japan Team!<END>

//Our plan is going perfectly!<LINE>
//We're counting on you, Gino!<END>

//It's now or never!<END>

//Hernandez comes out without hesitation!<END>

//Tsubasa, I've got this!<LINE>
//Be ready to take the ball!<END>

//Got it!<END>

//Hyuga jumps to get the ball!<END>

//Hernandez jumps too, on the edge<LINE>
//of the penalty area!<END>

//My God!<END>

//Hyuga jumped the highest,<LINE>
//but Hernandez was able to grab<LINE>
//the ball with one hand!<END>

//Oh! Hernandez drops the ball!<END>

//My turn to play!<END>

//Tsubasa charges towards the ball!<END>

//I won't let you do that!<END>

//Oh! Hernandez kicked the ball<LINE>
//before Tsubasa had a chance<LINE>
//to shoot! What an aerial play<LINE>
//by Hernandez!<END>

//Ah!<END>

//Hernandez stops another scoring chance<LINE>
//by the All Japan Team!<END>

//Hernandez clears the ball far ahead!<END>

//Oh no!<END>

//Italy is launching a counter-attack!<END>

//It's like they all knew<LINE>
//the ball would be cleared<LINE>
//far ahead!<END>

//They planned for this from the beginning!<END>

//The All Japan Team attacked too high<LINE>
//and now they find themselves<LINE>
//with a decimated defense!<END>

//The Italian passing game is lightning fast!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu is out of his goal!<END>

//Raah!<END>

//But the Italians are in numbers!<LINE>
//Conti is alone in front of the goal<LINE>
//and shoots!<END>

//I've got it!<END>

//Aaah!<END>

//Goooal!<END>

//The Italy Jr. Youth Team scores first<LINE>
//on a counter-attack triggered<LINE>
//by their goalkeeper Hernandez!<END>

//Our plan is working perfectly.<END>

//This goal hurts the All Japan...<LINE>
//We'll see how their captain<LINE>
//Tsubasa Ozora will react!<END>
