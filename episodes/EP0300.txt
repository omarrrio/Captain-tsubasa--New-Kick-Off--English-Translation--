//Azumaichi School is our first opponent<LINE>
//in the national tournament.<LINE>
//Souda, their captain, plays in defense.<LINE>
//This team is therefore particularly<LINE>
//defensive.<END>

//Scoring against the opposing team's captain<LINE>
//is not Souda's only strength.<LINE>
//During the Osaka tournament, against the<LINE>
//Naniwa School led by Nakanishi,<LINE>
//it was his long-range shots that massacred<LINE>
//the opposing team.<END>

//Beware of Souda's long-range shots<LINE>
//and their counterattacks!<END>

//Listen to me well!<LINE>
//Nankatsu is all about Tsubasa Ozora!<LINE>
//Block him and victory is ours!<END>

//Souda, it will be your job<LINE>
//to mark Tsubasa!<LINE>
//We are counting on you!<END>

//I'll take care of it.<LINE>
//I can't wait to take down Tsubasa Ozora<LINE>
//in front of all these people!<END>

//I'll show them what a real defender is!<END>

//And so, under the admiring gazes<LINE>
//of the crowd, today's match will begin.<LINE>
//Nankatsu versus Azumaichi!<END>

//We're here to support you<LINE>
//as promised!<END>

//Oh! But that's Urabe!<END>

//You beat us to represent<LINE>
//Shizuoka prefecture!<LINE>
//So you better win today!<LINE>
//I won't accept a defeat!<END>

//Alright! Enjoy the show!<END>

//Hey, guys.<LINE>
//Shut up and hurry up and get on<LINE>
//the field!<END>

//What?!<END>

//I'm tired of hearing<LINE>
//that you've been champions for two years.<LINE>
//Line up and get ready quickly.<END>

//Wait, you...<END>

//Ishizaki!<END>

//...<END>

//So, you're Tsubasa Ozora?<LINE>
//You're not that tall in real life.<LINE>
//Just so you know, I'm the one who's going<LINE>
//to mark you today.<END>

//Tsubasa, that's Souda.<LINE>
//He scored the winning goal<LINE>
//in the Osaka final against Nakanishi.<END>

//I see.<END>

//The players have taken their positions<LINE>
//on the field.<LINE>
//Nankatsu and Azumaichi will open<LINE>

//Tournament.<LINE>
//The match is about to begin!<END>
