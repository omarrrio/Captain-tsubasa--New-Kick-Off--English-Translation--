//And the game restarts<LINE>
//with a corner kick from Hanawa.<END>

//Oh! This must be Nankatsu's ultimate strategy!<END>

//Kisugi and Taki are already<LINE>
//on the crossbar,<LINE>
//ready to block the Tachibana brothers' Skylab Hurricane!<END>

//What?!<END>

//We can't replicate Tsubasa's move,<LINE>
//but at least we can jump onto the crossbar first!<END>

//That way, we'll block them<LINE>
//even if they attempt a Skylab Hurricane!<LINE>
//We won't let them equalize!<END>

//This is funny...<LINE>
//Come on, jump to see!<END>

//Let's go!<LINE>
//Tsubasa stopped us once,<LINE>
//but even if he were still here,<LINE>
//he couldn't do anything against us!<END>

//And this Skylab Hurricane will prove it.<LINE>
//Look at this!<END>

//This time, Masao is below.<LINE>
//Hanawa will attempt a Skylab Hurricane<LINE>
//as planned.<END>

//Jump, Kisugi! Taki!<LINE>
//Jump as high as possible<LINE>
//and block them!<END>

//OK!<END>

//Daimaru is in front of the goal<LINE>
//and sends the ball forward!<END>

//What?!<END>

//Huh? This time, it's a low ball!<END>

//Let's go!<END>

//The Skylab Hurricane doesn't necessarily<LINE>
//have to be done in the air, but<LINE>
//at any angle.<END>

//Let's go!<LINE>
//A low altitude Skylab Hurricane!<END>

//Huh?<END>

//Low?<END>

//But...<END>

//Kisugi and Taki are on the crossbar!<LINE>
//They won't come down in time!<LINE>
//And Morisaki won't be able to catch it<LINE>
//either!<END>

//Gooooal!<END>

//Oh, Tsubasa, who had been absent<LINE>
//for a few minutes,<LINE>
//returns to the field.<END>

//How's your shoulder?<END>

//I'll be fine.<END>

//Sorry, Tsubasa. As you can see,<LINE>
//they managed to equalize.<END>

//They caught up to us, so we'll have to<LINE>
//take the lead again! Let's go, guys!<END>
