//Drive shoot!<END>

//I won't let you get<LINE>
//into Toho's goal!<LINE>
//Tiger shot!<END>

//Hyuga is facing the ball!<LINE>
//Will he be able to repel the Drive shoot<LINE>
//with a Tiger shot?<END>

//It's a duel! A face-to-face!<END>

//It's...It's incredible!<LINE>
//Both players struck the ball<LINE>
//at the same moment and with<LINE>
//the same force which didn't<LINE>
//budge an inch!<LINE>
//Tsubasa and Hyuga were repelled<LINE>
//by the violence of the impact!<END>

//Oh, Tsubasa stands up!<END>

//Come on! My dream depends on you!<LINE>
//Be my victory!<LINE>
//Drive shoot!<END>

//Tsubasa's Drive shoot flies<LINE>
//into the air.<END>

//I'll stop it!<LINE>
//I'll show you<LINE>
//that I can stop it!<END>

//Tegatana defense!<END>

//Oh! He blocked it!<LINE>
//Nankatsu didn't score!<END>

//But after stopping the shot,<LINE>
//Wakashimazu lost his balance,<LINE>
//and hit the goal post<LINE>
//with his right shoulder!<END>

//The ball now rolls towards Tsubasa!<END>

//But Tsubasa fell to his knees!<LINE>
//What's going on?<END>

//The ball...My friend comes back to me.<END>

//I'll score! Yes, I'll score!<END>

//I'll keep using my Drive shoot<LINE>
//until we break<LINE>
//Toho's defense.<LINE>
//Until Nankatsu's victory!<END>

//Come on! I have to move!<END>

//Rrraagh! Tiger...<END>

//Shot!<END>

//He returned it!<END>

//Does he seriously think to take<LINE>
//advantage of the rebound<LINE>
//of Tsubasa's Drive shoot on the post<LINE>
//to aim for Nankatsu's goal?<END>

//It's...It's the final shot!<END>

//What?!<END>

//It's returned again!<END>

//Tsubasa returns it with a Drive shoot!<END>

//He performed a Jumping high volley kick<LINE>
//to shoot the ball<LINE>
//that Hyuga had already returned to him!<END>

//This time, for sure!<LINE>
//He's going to score and it will be<LINE>
//Nankatsu's third victory!<END>

//Rrraaagh!<END>

//Oh! Wakashimazu is standing up!<LINE>
//Even though he was injured on the ground,<LINE>
//he's now attempting a dive<LINE>
//using the post as leverage!<END>

//He caught the shot with his chest!<END>

//But it's not enough!<LINE>
//Even though he caught the ball,<LINE>
//he's going to fall with it into the goal.<END>

//Come on!<END>

//I'll stop it!<LINE>
//I won't let Tsubasa...<LINE>
//I won't let Nankatsu<LINE>
//score another goal!<END>

//He stopped it! He stopped it again!<END>

//As Wakashimazu was about to fall<LINE>
//into the goal, Hyuga dove<LINE>
//to catch him!<END>

//The ball ended its trajectory<LINE>
//just in front of the goal line!<END>
