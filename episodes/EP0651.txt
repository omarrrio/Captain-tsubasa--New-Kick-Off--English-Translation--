//OK, let's go!<END>

//You think you can get away with that?<LINE>
//<END>

//Ah!<END>

//Matsuyama, the captain of Furano, has<LINE>
//come back here and intercepted the ball.<END>

//OK, let's go!<LINE>
//Everyone forward!<LINE>
//It's time for the Avalanche<LINE>

//What? The Avalanche?<END>

//Oh! Furano counter-attacks!<LINE>
//All the players of Furano are heading<LINE>
//towards Nankatsu's goal!<END>

//What's happening?<LINE>
//They're all moving up the field!<END>

//Come on, come on, guys!<LINE>
//I'll send you the ball!<END>

//It's a bold tactic!<LINE>
//They must all have complete confidence<LINE>
//in Matsuyama and his ability to keep<LINE>
//the ball.<END>

//Kisugi and Taki try to<LINE>
//take the ball from him,<LINE>
//but Matsuyama won't let them!<END>

//He's reputed to have<LINE>
//the best ball control in the tournament.<END>

//!<END>

//Tsubasa also runs towards Matsuyama!<END>

//I'll pass it long<LINE>
//before he gets here!<END>

//There!<END>

//Matsuyama made a long pass ahead to his<LINE>
//teammates who are moving up the field.<END>

//No matter how many there are,<LINE>
//there's only one ball!<LINE>
//I'll counter their attack<LINE>
//by clearing the ball!<END>

//That won't work...<LINE>
//They're covering each other.<END>

//Yes, even if you intercept the ball,<LINE>
//we'll take it back by covering<LINE>
//each other.<LINE>
//That's the Avalanche of Furano!<END>

//Will the Avalanche of Furano succeed<LINE>
//in breaking through Nankatsu's defense?<END>
