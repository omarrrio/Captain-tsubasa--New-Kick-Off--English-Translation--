//We're going to win this match!<LINE>
//This will be the last one without Hyuga!<END>

//Stay strong, Takeshi!<LINE>
//We won't lose to<LINE>
//a bunch of kids!<END>

//Well, it seems like two players<LINE>
//from Meiwa-Higashi are marking Sawada,<LINE>
//Toho's playmaker!<END>

//Here we go!<END>

//Sawada still manages to make<LINE>
//a pass!<END>

//Oh, but it doesn't reach its target!<END>

//They were expecting a pass<LINE>
//to Sorimachi!<END>

//Agh!<END>

//Great! They're doing exactly<LINE>
//what we planned!<END>

//And Meiwa-Higashi is<LINE>
//positioning for a shot!<END>

//No!<END>

//Oh! But Wakashimazu deflects the ball!<END>

//It's amazing!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu reacted in time<LINE>
//to block the shot.<LINE>
//Without that, the opposing team<LINE>
//would have scored a goal!<END>

//The ball has been deflected,<LINE>
//but it's still in play.<LINE>
//The action is taking place inside<LINE>
//the penalty area!<END>

//Clear the ball! Kick it far!<END>

//Which player will reach it first?<END>

//Toho's player?<LINE>
//Or Meiwa-Higashi's?<END>

//Take this!<LINE>
//Meiwa's kamikaze sliding squad,<LINE>
//here we come!<END>

//What!<END>

//Wow! Goal! Goal!<LINE>
//Meiwa's tenacity has finally paid off!<END>

//Huh...<END>

//It seems that center-forward Sawaki<LINE>
//was the last one to touch the ball.<LINE>
//In any case, we witnessed<LINE>
//a storm of sliding tackles<LINE>
//by Meiwa-Higashi!<END>

//Everyone near the ball deflected by Wakashimazu<LINE>
//went for sliding shots to score<LINE>
//the first goal!<END>

//Alright! We scored a goal!<LINE>
//We're dominating the match from now on!<END>

//...<END>

//Wait, Hyuga!<END>

//What are you doing?<LINE>
//I have no intention of letting you<LINE>
//participate in this match!<END>

//...<END>

//Sit down, Hyuga!<LINE>
//It's an order from your coach!<END>

//Orders, orders,<LINE>
//always orders...<END>

//Do you think you're the master of the world?<LINE>
//Are you always right?<END>

//What did you say?<END>

//Why... why can't I play?<END>

//Wait, Hyuga!<END>

//Come here, guys!<LINE>
//It's just one goal!<LINE>
//You can come back, I'm sure of it!<END>

//Win this match without me!<LINE>
//You have to win, guys!<END>

//Hyuga...<END>

//Captain...<END>

//Hyuga...<END>

//I'll play in the final!<END>

//Alright...<LINE>
//Get ready, guys! It's just one goal,<LINE>
//like the captain said!<LINE>
//We'll take it back from them!<END>

////Yeah! We made it here without<LINE>
//the captain! We'll show them<LINE>
//what Toho is made of!<END>
