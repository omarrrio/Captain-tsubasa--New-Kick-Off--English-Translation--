//We are now about to witness<LINE>
//the penalty shootout.<END>

//The penalty shootout will decide which<LINE>
//of the two teams will go to the final.<END>

//It's Pierre, the captain of France,<LINE>
//who will take the first penalty kick!<END>

//Here comes Japan's goalkeeper, Wakashimazu.<END>

//Wakashimazu is a specialist<LINE>
//in penalty shootouts. One might wonder<LINE>
//if his reflexes will still be as sharp<LINE>
//with fatigue and his injury<LINE>
//to his right hand...<END>

//Gooooooooal!<LINE>
//It was a powerful shot!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu had no chance<LINE>
//to stop it!<END>

//France has started the<LINE>
//penalty shootout well.<LINE>
//Who will take the next<LINE>
//penalty kick for Japan?<END>

//Oh! It's going to be Hyuga!<END>

//Japan's star striker, Hyuga,<LINE>
//is taking the responsibility of taking<LINE>
//the first penalty kick.<END>

//All the spectators are behind<LINE>
//the French goalkeeper, Amoro.<END>

//They really hope to see France<LINE>
//in the final.<END>

//Hyuga, don't let the crowd distract you.<LINE>
//Do what you have to do!<END>

//I know.<END>

//Thanks, Tsubasa.<LINE>
//You always know the right words to say.<END>

//Hyuga scores without hesitation!<LINE>
//He once again demonstrates that Japan<LINE>
//is determined to win this match.<END>

//France and Japan have both scored<LINE>
//one goal each.<END>

//It's now the turn of<LINE>
//the second penalty takers.<END>

//Both Frenchman Bossis and Japan's<LINE>
//Matsuyama score!<END>

//Ferreri and Misaki also do their job<LINE>
//with ease!<END>

//Same for Rust and Misugi<LINE>
//who score without any trouble!<END>

//And now it's time for<LINE>
//the fifth penalty takers…<LINE>
//It's Napoléon who will take<LINE>
//the penalty kick for France<LINE>
//and most likely Tsubasa for Japan.<END>

//If both teams don't separate,<LINE>
//we will enter into sudden death.<END>

//Here comes France's star striker,<LINE>
//Louis Napoléon.<END>

//Hey, goalkeeper! You may have prevented me<LINE>
//from scoring my third hat trick<LINE>
//in three consecutive matches...<END>

//But you won't stop me from becoming<LINE>
//the top scorer of the competition!<LINE>
//I'm two goals behind Schneider,<LINE>
//but I'll catch up easily<LINE>
//during tomorrow's final!<END>

//All that matters to me now is<LINE>
//to win this match, win the tournament<LINE>
//tomorrow, and then get the title<LINE>
//of the competition's top scorer!<END>

//I'm mad at you for the hat trick, but<LINE>
//I'll take revenge by scoring this penalty.<END>

//I have a 50-50 chance.<LINE>
//I'll dive to the right again,<LINE>
//regardless of my injury!<LINE>
//Misugi put his life on the line,<LINE>
//my injury is nothing compared to that!<END>

//I'll smash this right hand<LINE>
//to pieces!<END>

//Take that! Cannon shoot!<END>

//We'll see about that!<END>

//Shoken defense!<END>

//Oh! He stopped the penalty!<END>

//Wakashimazu stopped the Canon shot<LINE>
//from Napoléon with his fist!<END>

//W-what?<END>

//Did you see? I stopped it!<END>

//Great save, Wakashimazu!<END>

//Well played, Wakashimazu!<END>

//The karate goalkeeper, Ken Wakashimazu,<LINE>
//was probably the man of the match!<END>

//My right wrist is finished...<LINE>
//I'm counting on you, Tsubasa!<END>

//The 5th shooter for All Japan is<LINE>
//none other than their captain,<LINE>
//Tsubasa Ozora.<END>

//Well played, Wakashimazu.<LINE>
//Your sacrifice won't be in vain.<LINE>
//I realize that you won't recover<LINE>
//from your injury as quickly.<END>

//If Tsubasa scores, Japan will<LINE>
//reach the final tomorrow!<END>

//All of France is praying for Tsubasa<LINE>
//to miss his penalty...<END>

//Tsubasa is running up to the ball...<END>

//Goooooooooal!<LINE>
//Tsubasa has scored the winning goal!<END>

//Japan wins their spot in the<LINE>
//finals through a penalty shootout!<END>

//Tsubasa!<END>

//We won! Wakashimazu, we won<LINE>
//thanks to you!<END>
