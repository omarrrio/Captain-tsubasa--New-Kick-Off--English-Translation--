//Captain!<END>

//Hyuga.<END>

//Coach Kitazume, please accept<LINE>
//this, please!<END>

//...<END>

//...<END>

//If someone had told me I would end up<LINE>
//like this one day, but...<END>

//It's the least I can do<LINE>
//for you.<LINE>
//Please! I beg you, let me play<LINE>
//in the next match!<END>

//Look at me, Hyuga!<END>

//I've always trained the team my way.<END>

//And that's why I've decided not<LINE>
//to let you participate in this tournament.<LINE>
//You understand, Hyuga?<END>

//I see... I don't care about any of that.<LINE>
//I'm playing tomorrow, period!<END>

//No matter if I have to fight<LINE>
//against you or prove myself on the field,<LINE>
//but I will play in the team tomorrow!<END>

//Toho doesn't belong to one man!<LINE>
//I won't let you kick me out<LINE>
//on a whim!<END>

//You're the only one who has always acted<LINE>
//on a whim!<END>

//Grrr!<END>

//Hold on, captain!<LINE>
//You too, coach!<END>

//Listen to me, coach!<LINE>
//Let Hyuga play, please!<END>

//The captain was wrong to leave<LINE>
//the team without your permission.<END>

//But during his stay in Okinawa,<LINE>
//he trained harder than anyone else here,<LINE>
//with the sole aim of beating Nankatsu!<END>

//Coach, please!<LINE>
//Let our captain play!<END>

//Guys...<END>

//Do you really want Hyuga to play<LINE>
//in the match, huh?<END>

//That ball of pride, Hyuga,<LINE>
//knelt down in front of me and begged.<END>

//And his teammates are asking for him<LINE>
//even though he let them down...<LINE>
//Not to mention he hasn't played<LINE>
//a single match in this tournament...<END>

//But I... I have decided in my heart<LINE>
//and conscience that he will not participate<LINE>
//in the tournament.<LINE>
//I cannot reverse my decision.<END>

//Someone bring me a ball.<LINE>
//And some light too.<END>

//Huh?<END>

//Hyuga, you said Toho<LINE>
//doesn't belong to me.<LINE>
//But I, the coach,<LINE>
//am the one who leads this team.<END>

//And Toho worked hard to make it<LINE>
//to the finals without you.<END>

//We can thank Sorimachi, Sawada<LINE>
//and Wakashimazu.<LINE>
//Can you score a goal facing<LINE>
//them on the field?<END>

//Do you promise to let me play<LINE>
//if I do?<END>

//But if they purposely let the goal pass<LINE>
//so you can participate in the match, I won't let you<LINE>
//onto the field! Got it?<END>

//I'm playing! I will defeat Tsubasa<LINE>
//with my Tiger Shot!<END>

//What!<END>

//Wakashimazu didn't budge an inch!<END>

//No-no! I didn't do it on purpose!<LINE>
//It... it happened too fast for me!<END>

//Here's the lineup<LINE>
//for tomorrow's match against Nankatsu!<END>

//Center forward... Kojiro Hyuga!<END>

//Great!<END>

//Coach Kitazume from Toho Gakuen?<LINE>
//My name is Kozo Kira.<END>

//Coach Kira!<END>

//I ask you to play Kojiro<LINE>
//during today's match!<END>

//...<END>

//Mr. Kira, please<LINE>
//listen to me.<LINE>
//Rest assured, I plan to play<LINE>
//Hyuga throughout the match.<END>

//Really?<END>

//Hyuga did yesterday what you just<LINE>
//did now.<END>

//Oh? Kojiro?<END>

//Coach...<END>

//Anyway, good luck!<LINE>
//You have a great chance of winning<LINE>
//with such a team!<END>

//We will beat Nankatsu and bring back<LINE>
//the championship flag to Toho Gakuen,<LINE>
//where it truly belongs!<END>

//Yes!<END>

//Finally, I will submit my resignation<LINE>
//letter after the match.<END>

//Very well! Let's go, guys!<LINE>
//Let's crush Nankatsu!<END>

//It's been a long time since we<LINE>
//played together, Hyuga, but I'm sure<LINE>
//we'll make a good duo!<END>

//Finally back on the field!<LINE>
//I need you guys.<LINE>
//I don't want to lose to Tsubasa again!<END>

//Tsubasa...<LINE>
//I have devoted the last four years<LINE>
//of my life to prepare for this moment...<LINE>
//My last match in the college league!<END>

//A request for a match?<END>
