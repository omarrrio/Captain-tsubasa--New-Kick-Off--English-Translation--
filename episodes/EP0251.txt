//And the Otomo Quartet,<LINE>
//in excellent condition<LINE>
//for this tournament,<LINE>
//is waiting for Tsubasa!<LINE>
//They are the cornerstone<LINE>
//of Otomo's defense!<END>

//The spectators are going wild<LINE>
//at such a confrontation!<END>

//Come on, Tsubasa!<LINE>
//I can promise we're going to stop you.<END>

//This year, our only objectives<LINE>
//are to defeat Nankatsu<LINE>
//and its captain Tsubasa!<END>

//We have trained ourselves...<END>

//To be as fast<LINE>
//as Tsubasa...<END>

//To be able to counter any<LINE>
//of his moves...<END>

//We may not have your talent,<LINE>
//but we have nothing to be ashamed<LINE>
//of in terms of effort and training!<END>

//Take a look at the result, Tsubasa!<LINE>
//You'll never get past us!<END>

//There are four of them, but this time,<LINE>
//I'll get through!<LINE>
//I'll make them pay<LINE>
//for earlier.<END>

//And there's the clash<LINE>
//between the two opponents!<END>

//!!<END>

//What's that...<LINE>
//Tsubasa suddenly changed position!<END>

//He managed to make a backward pass<LINE>
//while falling down!<END>

//What quick reflexes!<LINE>
//Whatever moves I make,<LINE>
//they're already one step ahead!<END>

//Well played, Tsubasa.<END>

//You anticipated our defense<LINE>
//and chose a backward pass...<LINE>
//So now you understand?<LINE>
//Running away is your only way out.<END>
