//Coach, before the briefing, I have<LINE>
//something to give to everyone.<END>

//Take a look at it.<END>

//It's information about Germany,<LINE>
//our opponent today!<END>

//It's all there! Their strengths,<LINE>
//their weaknesses, their style of play!<END>

//Wakabayashi...<END>

//I've been collecting this information<LINE>
//for a while now, and I finally put it all together yesterday.<END>

//I've already played with Schneider and Kaltz,<LINE>
//and against Schester and Margas. Everything<LINE>
//there should be very accurate.<END>

//There's no need to memorize everyone's data.<LINE>
//Only the data of the player you'll<LINE>
//be marking should be enough.<END>

//Thanks, Wakabayashi!<END>

//Genzo, I can't believe<LINE>
//you put all this together...<END>

//You can start the briefing.<END>

//Hmmm, yes.<END>

//Well, I have nothing to add<LINE>
//to what I've already told you.<LINE>
//Give everything you have on the field<LINE>
//as you have done until today.<LINE>
//That's all!<END>

//Yes!<END>

//Otherwise, regarding<LINE>
//the goalkeeper position...<END>

//Genzo Wakabayashi!<LINE>
//I'm counting on you today!<END>

//What?<END>

//But... I wasn't supposed to play<LINE>
//in this tournament...<END>

//Besides, I haven't trained<LINE>
//with the defenders... and I...<END>

//It's only you, Wakabayashi.<END>

//Huh?<END>

//If Wakashimazu can't play,<LINE>
//you're the only one who can replace him.<END>

//Morisaki...<END>

//He's right. You're the only one who can<LINE>
//guard our goal now.<END>

//Hyuga...<END>

//As long as you give everything you have<LINE>
//and don't try to give<LINE>
//the other team an advantage, no one<LINE>
//will object to you guarding our goal.<END>

//Our team spirit will be indestructible<LINE>
//as long as we all have the same<LINE>
//and only goal: victory!<END>

//Before, I hated Tsubasa more than anything.<LINE>
//But since we've been on the same team,<LINE>
//I count on him a lot.<END>

//I don't mind passing the ball to Tsubasa<LINE>
//if victory is at stake.<END>

//That's what soccer is, Wakabayashi.<END>

//Hyuga...<END>

//And then, I heard you and Tsubasa<LINE>
//talking after the first match<LINE>
//of the tour.<END>

//Everything you did was<LINE>
//to make us stronger, right?<END>

//You know you're a bad actor, right?<END>

//But thanks to you, we've become stronger<LINE>
//in a very short time.<END>

//So, what are you going to do,<LINE>
//Wakabayashi? You still don't<LINE>
//intend to play?<LINE>
//You just wanted to be there<LINE>
//to relay information about<LINE>
//the German team to us?<END>

//Guys...<END>

//I... I...<END>

//In the Japanese goal, we will see<LINE>
//Genzo Wakabayashi today!<END>

//I'm counting on you, Wakabayashi.<END>

//This is Wakabayashi's first start<LINE>
//in this tournament.<END>

//Wa-Wakabayashi?<END>

//Wakabayashi is going to play?<END>

//So you're really going to play, huh?<END>

//Better late than never...<END>

//It looks like we'll have the chance<LINE>
//to face each other today, Wakabayashi!<END>

//Schneider, I won't lose.<END>
