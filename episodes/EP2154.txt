//Come on, Hyuga.<LINE>
//If I manage to stop you,<LINE>
//I'll tie the score.<END>

//Yes! That's exactly what<LINE>
//I hoped for.<LINE>
//Get ready, Misugi!<END>

//Misugi attempts to block Hyuga's<LINE>
//dribble! Hyuga seeks to keep the ball!<LINE>
//These two are in a fierce struggle!<END>

//Will Hyuga be able to make<LINE>
//his way to the goal, or will<LINE>
//Misugi steal the ball from him?<END>

//Hyuga really doesn't seem<LINE>
//to want to pass the ball<LINE>
//to a teammate!<END>

//I have to make it!<END>

//I have to...<END>

//...stop him!<END>

//Huh?<END>

//What happened? Misugi fell,<LINE>
//giving Hyuga the opportunity<LINE>
//to take the ball!<END>

//Hey guys!<END>

//What's going on?<END>

//Hey! Misugi sent the ball<LINE>
//far away from Hyuga as he fell!<END>

//Musashi recovers the lost ball!<END>

//...<END>

//Musashi quickly launches an attack,<LINE>
//but Misugi is still on the ground!<END>

//Do what Misugi says!<LINE>
//We have to act quickly!<END>

//Toho is moving to block Musashi's attack!<END>

//Come on, kids!<LINE>
//Misugi is the only one who can score<LINE>
//in my goal!<END>

//Will Musashi's team manage<LINE>
//to tie the game, or will they<LINE>
//run into Toho's defense?<LINE>
//We may be witnessing a turning<LINE>
//point in the match!<END>

//Look at this!<LINE>
//Musashi makes a stunning<LINE>
//series of passes!<END>

//Each player makes a<LINE>
//pass by deviation!<END>

//The goalkeeper is Wakashimazu!<LINE>
//There's no point in shooting<LINE>
//from far away, it'll never make it!<END>

//Get as close to the goal as<LINE>
//possible and shoot from there.<LINE>
//That's the only way to do it!<END>

//It looks like Misugi's tenacity<LINE>
//has influenced Musashi!<END>

//We have an opening!<LINE>
//It's up to you, Honma!<END>

//Wow! And there it is,<LINE>
//Musashi's final pass!<END>

//I, Ken Wakashimazu,<LINE>
//swear to give up football forever<LINE>
//if I let you score a third goal!<END>

//Wakashimazu charges out of the goal,<LINE>
//but Honma is already in shooting position!<END>

//"No one will stop me from scoring this goal!"<END>

//"Wow!"<END>

//"What!"<END>

//"Phew!"<END>

//"Wakashimazu...stopped it!"<END>

//"He saw that one hand wouldn't be enough,<LINE>
//so he joined his two hands<LINE>
//and jumped at the right moment<LINE>
//to block the shot!"<END>

//"The Toho defenders can't even<LINE>
//get close to the ball!"<END>
