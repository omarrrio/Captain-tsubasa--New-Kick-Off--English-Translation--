//Here you go!<END>

//Oh! Sorimachi passes instead of shooting!<LINE>
//He passes it to Hyuga!<END>

//Shoot, Captain!<END>

//Yeah! Welcome back, Captain!<END>

//Guys!<END>

//Hyuga receives the pass.<LINE>
//He is alone facing the Nankatsu goalkeeper!<LINE>
//And here comes Hyuga's Tiger Shot!<END>

//The winning goal...<LINE>
//The championship goal!<LINE>
//It's up to you to score it for Toho, Hyuga!<END>

//Let's go, guys!<END>

//Oh, but another player charges<LINE>
//from the side!<END>

//It's Tsubasa Ozora of Nankatsu!<END>

//Tsubasa!<END>

//But Hyuga sticks to his usual routine<LINE>
//and shoots!<LINE>
//Here comes the Tiger Shot!<END>

//What?!<END>

//He stops!<LINE>
//Hyuga doesn't shoot!<END>

//I didn't stop my play because<LINE>
//of Tsubasa's health condition!<END>

//I just want every pass from my team<LINE>
//to end up in their captain's real goal!<END>

//That's why I stopped!<END>

//Ragh! It's not over yet!<END>

//Wow! And Ishizaki dives<LINE>
//in front of Hyuga's Tiger Shot!<END>

//Will Ishizaki perform<LINE>
//his famous Frontal Block?<END>

//What?!<END>

//Damn it! Hyuga still hasn't shot!<END>

//Ishizaki, I knew you would<LINE>
//intervene!<END>

//And now...<LINE>
//There is no one left to defend<LINE>
//Nankatsu's goal!<END>

//And here comes the Tiger Shot!<LINE>
//Goal!<LINE>
//Hyuga had anticipated every move<LINE>
//by Nankatsu!<END>

//Toho Gakuen leads Nankatsu by one goal.<LINE>
//The team is getting closer to victory!<END>

//Hyuga!<END>

//I did it, guys!<LINE>
//Your passes allowed me to score!<END>
