//And this time, it's Hyuga who wins.<END>

//Hyuga dribbles up the field alone.<END>

//I refuse to lose!<LINE>
//I refuse to lose again!<LINE>

//Come on if you want!<LINE>
//And try to stop me!<LINE>
//No matter how many of you there are!<END>

//Taste my Tiger Shot!<END>

//Argh!<END>

//is a steamroller!<LINE>
//This superb shot allows Toho<LINE>
//to score a goal!<END>
