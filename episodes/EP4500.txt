//Our strategy remains the same!<LINE>
//In the first half, focus on defense.<LINE>
//And in the second half,<LINE>
//attack relying on Misugi!<END>

//OK!<END>

//Misugi, get ready to enter<LINE>
//the field.<END>

//If we manage to neutralize<LINE>
//Nankatsu's attacks, I will only send you<LINE>
//in the second half.<LINE>
//But we're talking about Nankatsu...<END>

//Depending on how things go,<LINE>
//I may ask you to come in earlier,<LINE>
//like during the match against Toho<LINE>
//in the Tokyo tournament.<END>

//Yes, coach!<END>

//Guys! I too have been waiting<LINE>
//for this final for a long time!<END>

//And I know that most of us<LINE>
//remember our defeat three years ago in<LINE>
//the rain against Nankatsu SC,<LINE>
//and that fateful long-range shot...<END>

//Today's match is the opportunity<LINE>
//to take our revenge!<END>

//Yes!<END>

//Finally...<LINE>
//I will have to mark Tsubasa<LINE>
//in the midfield as much as possible...<END>

//Here we are, at last, at the final of<LINE>
//the National Junior High School Tournament.<END>

//For the past three years,<LINE>
//the final has pitted teams<LINE>
//from Tokyo and Shizuoka,<LINE>
//and this year is no exception<LINE>
//to the rule. Except that, this time,<LINE>
//it is Musashi Junior High School<LINE>
//that represents Tokyo...<END>

//And they qualified for the national<LINE>
//tournament by beating the team from Hyuga,<LINE>
//Toho Gakuen!<END>

//Shizuoka is once again represented<LINE>
//by Nankatsu, which is aiming<LINE>
//for a third consecutive title!<END>

//All eyes will be on<LINE>
//the two football prodigies,<LINE>
//the two captains,<LINE>
//Misugi and Tsubasa!<END>

//This final will determine<LINE>
//the best team in the country!<LINE>
//And here's the kickoff!<END>
