//I'll stop you!<END>

//Wakashimazu quickly returned<LINE>
//and punched the ball away!<END>

//It's my turn now!<END>

//And Misugi runs towards the ball repelled<LINE>
//by Wakashimazu!<END>

//Is this a joke?<END>

//But Sawada from Toho is also arriving!<END>

//I'll have to shoot on the fly<LINE>
//before Sawada catches up to me!<LINE>
//And for that...<END>

//I'll have to do this!<END>

//Wow! Misugi pivots in full stride<LINE>
//and prepares for an acrobatic overhead kick!<END>

//Come on!<END>

//Misugi did an Overhead Shot<LINE>
//before Sawada caught up to him!<END>

//The goalkeeper Wakashimazu is still<LINE>
//out of his goal!<LINE>
//The ball passes behind him!<END>

//Do you really think I'll let you score<LINE>
//again?<END>

//Do you really think so?<END>

//Wakashimazu does his famous dive<LINE>
//with support from the post!<LINE>
//Will he arrive in time?<END>

//Come on! Go in!<END>

//He didn't manage to reach it!<LINE>
//Another goal for Musashi!<END>

//I was too slow!<END>

//After a magnificent ball control,<LINE>
//Misugi's Overhead Shot ended up<LINE>
//in the right part of the goal!<END>

//And there's the goal!<END>

//Argh...<END>

//Captain!<END>

//Misugi, are you okay?<END>

//It looks very serious!<LINE>
//I'll replace you immediately!<LINE>
//It's too risky for your health<LINE>
//to let you play further.<END>

//Coach, wait!<END>

//?<END>

//I'm fine, I can still play.<END>

//But...<END>

//It's okay.<LINE>
//I rested during the break,<LINE>
//and I know my body<LINE>
//better than anyone.<END>

//Give me one last chance!<LINE>
//Please, coach!<END>

//It seemed to me that Misugi was going to be<LINE>
//replaced. But he continues the match.<END>
