//Tsubasa is given the cup<LINE>
//by the tournament director.<END>

//Hurray!<END>

//The All Japan Team is now at<LINE>
//the top of the under-16s!<LINE>
//This victory is the result<LINE>
//of a tremendous team effort!<END>

//Let's now join Tsubasa Ozora<LINE>
//for his comments on their victory.<END>

//Huh? What? A speech?<END>

//Don't worry, there's an interpreter.<END>

//Ah, but...um...<END>

//The captain of Japan, Tsubasa, will<LINE>
//now give us a few words<LINE>
//about his team's victory.<END>

//So, first of all, I want to thank all<LINE>
//of you for your encouragement.<END>

//We promised ourselves to give<LINE>
//our best to win this competition.<LINE>
//I'm glad we were able to achieve our goal.<END>

//However, I don't think we're the best yet.<END>

//There are many nations that did not<LINE>
//participate in the tournament, such as Brazil,<LINE>
//considered the king of football.<END>

//Our real goal is to win<LINE>
//the international tournament.<LINE>
//That's when we'll truly know<LINE>
//who the best are.<END>

//It's probably just a dream,<LINE>
//but we're free to do everything<LINE>
//to make it come true.<LINE>
//We'll gain a lot from it.<END>

//Japan being the best football nation<LINE>
//in the world may be a dream...<LINE>
//But we...we...<END>

//We'll do everything to make it come true!<END>

//Japan now begins a victory lap.<END>

//Under the cheers of the crowd,<LINE>
//they go around the stadium.<END>

//The All Japan Jr. Youth Team is back<LINE>
//in front of their bench.<END>

//Let's applaud them one last time<LINE>
//for their outstanding performance<LINE>
//during the tournament!<END>

//!!!<END>

//Ro-Roberto...<END>

//Tsubasa.<END>

//Congratulations. You were impressive.<END>

//Roberto...<END>

//How are your eyes?<END>

//It's fine...<END>

//Roberto, after middle school...I...<LINE>
//I want to go to Brazil!<END>

//I know. I saw your video<LINE>
//that was sent to me in Brazil,<LINE>
//and I saw you play today<LINE>
//in person.<END>

//Your ability to create spaces<LINE>
//and organize play from midfield is impressive.<LINE>
//In addition, you behave like a true captain.<LINE>
//You've grown a lot, Tsubasa.<END>

//Ro-Roberto...<END>

//I hope you'll accept my help to make you<LINE>
//the best player in the world.<END>

//Of course!<LINE>
//Does that mean you're going to train me<LINE>
//again?<END>

//You bet!<END>

//I knew that if I kept playing<LINE>
//football and improving,<LINE>
//I would see you again one day.<END>

//The next day, the All Japan Jr. Youth<LINE>
//flew back to their country with<LINE>
//the cup of the 1st Annual French International<LINE>
//Jr. Youth Tournament.<END>

//For Tsubasa, a new chapter began<LINE>
//alongside his lifelong coach,<LINE>
//Roberto...<END>
