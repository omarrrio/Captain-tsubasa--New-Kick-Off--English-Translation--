//Splendid! Tsubasa makes a roulette<LINE>
//to lob his opponent!<END>

//He bypasses the defender on the side!<LINE>
//It's a two-step action!<END>

//But it's not over yet!<LINE>
//After bypassing the defender,<LINE>
//Tsubasa finishes with another of<LINE>
//his specialties, the Bicycle Kick!<END>

//Tsubasa shows us here<LINE>
//the full extent of his technique!<LINE>
//This will ultimately be a three-step action!<END>

//Go!<END>

//But Hernandez is in the path<LINE>
//of the ball!<END>

//He repels the ball! Hernandez has managed<LINE>
//to block Tsubasa's bicycle kick!<END>

//But the ball returns<LINE>
//to Tsubasa's feet...<END>

//I'll keep shooting<LINE>
//until it goes in!<END>

//Catch that, Hernandez!<END>

//Wow! Hernandez follows the action<LINE>
//and is already in the path of the ball!<END>

//We're not going to lose!<END>

//W-what a save! What a goalkeeper!<END>

//He's repelled both of Tsubasa's shots!<END>

//Impossible...<END>

//Wait! A player is rushing at an impressive speed<LINE>
//towards the deflected ball!<END>

//It's the All Japan Jr. Youth No. 9,<LINE>
//the center-forward Kojiro Hyuga!<END>

//All Italy Jr. Youth Team,<LINE>
//it's time for revenge!<END>

//You'll taste my shot,<LINE>
//you who have despised our football,<LINE>
//you who have not accepted<LINE>
//to face us in a friendly match!<END>

//I won't let you score!<LINE>
//Not as long as I have my Golden Right Foot!<END>

//Take this! Neo Tiger Shot!<END>

//Hernandez stops the ball!<END>

//The suspense lasted<LINE>
//until the final seconds of the match,<LINE>
//but the fate of the All Japan Team was sealed<LINE>
//by the Golden Right Foot of this impeccable<LINE>
//goalkeeper!<END>

//Aaaah!<END>

//But what's happening?<LINE>
//He can't contain the ball!<END>

//Goaaal! It's a goaaal!<END>

//Hyuga's shot, too powerful<LINE>
//for Hernandez's Golden Right Foot,<LINE>
//has gone into the back of the net!<END>
