//Huh?<END>

//Ah, Captain!<END>

//Hyuga!<END>

//I'm back from Okinawa, coach!<END>

//I don't plan on having you<LINE>
//participate in this tournament, Hyuga!<END>

//What!<END>

//Coach!<END>

//The first match of the tournament is against<LINE>
//Matsukami Junior High. We beat them<LINE>
//in the Tokyo qualifying match.<LINE>
//So we have a good chance of winning today!<END>

//As for Hyuga, like I've already said,<LINE>
//I don't plan on having him participate<LINE>
//in this tournament!<LINE>
//Sawada will be our playmaker,<LINE>
//and the ball will be sent to Sorimachi,<LINE>
//our center forward.<END>

//Yes, Coach.<END>

//The coach said he won't let Hyuga play,<LINE>
//but we can't win without him,<LINE>
//especially not against Nankatsu!<END>

//All we can do is unite our strengths<LINE>
//and keep winning to make it to the finals!<END>

//It seems that Hyuga won't be playing<LINE>
//during this match! We have nothing<LINE>
//to fear from Toho's defense.<LINE>
//You take control and<LINE>
//give it your all in defense!<END>

//Yeah!<END>
