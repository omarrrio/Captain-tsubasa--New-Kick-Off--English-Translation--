//Coach, where is Hyuga?<END>

//Hyuga won't come!<LINE>
//He doesn't need to train since he<LINE>
//won't participate in the tournament.<LINE>
//So I told him to go home.<END>

//W-why?<END>

//Coach, we can't win<LINE>
//without Hyuga!<END>

//That's right, coach!<END>

//That's enough!<LINE>
//You're not going to start this!<LINE>
//You don't have to criticize my orders!<END>

//Wakashimazu! From now on,<LINE>
//and until the end of the tournament,<LINE>
//I appoint you captain of the team.<END>

//Huh?<END>

//Understood?<END>

//Coach...<END>

//The coach is trying to remove me<LINE>
//from the game once again.<END>

//I don't care as long as Toho wins.<LINE>
//But they can't win without me<LINE>
//in the championship match<LINE>
//against Nankatsu.<END>

//I will play in the championship match!<LINE>
//I will help my teammates<LINE>
//to give their best<LINE>
//so that Toho wins the tournament.<LINE>
//I know what I have to do.<END>

//The starting lineup of the team will be<LINE>
//the same as yesterday.<END>

//Understood?<END>

//And Hyuga, coach?<END>

//Huh?<END>

//It will be fine.<LINE>
//I saw the other team's guys training.<LINE>
//You'll manage without any problem.<END>

//And then, in case things go wrong,<LINE>
//I'll be ready to enter the field<LINE>
//at any moment!<END>

//...<END>

//Hyuga...<END>

//What's going on?<LINE>
//Hyuga's not playing today either?<END>

//We're sure to win without Hyuga.<LINE>
//You're no match for us!<END>

//What?!<END>

//Repeat what you just said, idiot!<LINE>
//Even without their captain,<LINE>
//Toho will crush you flat!<END>

//Is that so? Hyuga seems to be carrying<LINE>
//the team all by himself<LINE>
//from what I've seen.<END>

//You'll see that we can win<LINE>
//without Hyuga!<END>
