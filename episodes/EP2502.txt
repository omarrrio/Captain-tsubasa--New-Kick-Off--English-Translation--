//And the referee just blew the final whistle<LINE>
//of the match!<LINE>
//The winner of the junior high national soccer tournament,<LINE>
//representing Tokyo, is Toho Gakuen!<END>

//We have witnessed three years<LINE>
//of fierce struggle between the same players.<LINE>
//This tournament allowed Toho Gakuen<LINE>
//to dethrone the defending champion,<LINE>
//Nankatsu!<END>

//We won!<LINE>
//We defeated Tsubasa and Nankatsu!<END>

//Hyuga!<END>

//Captain!<END>

//Hyuga's participation was uncertain, and it was thanks to Sorimachi,<LINE>
//Sawada, and Wakashimazu that the team was able to<LINE>
//reach the final.<END>

//But the arrival of their ace, Hyuga,<LINE>
//in the second half of the final,<LINE>
//allowed them to compromise Nankatsu's plans<LINE>
//for a third victory.<LINE>
//Toho Gakuen finally won the coveted title!<END>

//Tsubasa! I finally managed to beat you, even though<LINE>
//I had to wait until the last moment!<END>

//Hyuga.<END>

//But... If you had played at your best,<LINE>
//the result might have been different.<END>

//No, injuries are part of the game.<END>

//It's your presence on the field, Hyuga,<LINE>
//that allowed me to give it my all.<LINE>
//Toho Gakuen is an extraordinary team<LINE>
//thanks to its captain.<LINE>
//You defeated me.<END>

//Tsubasa... Go play in Brazil!<END>

//What?<END>

//I shouldn't tell you that,<LINE>
//since I just ruined<LINE>
//your record...<LINE>
//But as I've already told you, you're not<LINE>
//the type of player to spend<LINE>
//his life in Japan.<END>

//And if you keep hanging around,<LINE>
//I'll have no one else to defeat<LINE>
//but you.<END>

//Hyuga...<END>

//I think I learned a lot of positive things<LINE>
//about soccer by facing you on the field.<END>

//I want to aim higher, just like you.<END>

//Hyuga.<END>

//I'm not sure exactly what<LINE>
//at the moment, but it will come.<END>

//Hyuga. I... I'll go to Brazil<LINE>
//as soon as I finish middle school.<END>

//Tsubasa... I guess this puts<LINE>
//an end to our rivalry... at least<LINE>
//for now.<END>

//Yes.<END>

//The two captains, Hyuga and Tsubasa,<LINE>
//congratulate each other on the match they have<LINE>
//just played.<LINE>
//They are now exchanging jerseys!<LINE>
//They have no regrets about the match.<LINE>
//Both players have a radiant, smiling face!<END>

//The red banner of victory<LINE>
//is now handed over to Hyuga,<LINE>
//the captain of Toho Gakuen!<END>

//We won this flag<LINE>
//together, guys!<END>

//It was a great team effort.<LINE>
//You played well and won<LINE>
//Toho Gakuen's first championship!<END>

//Coach, please accept this.<END>

//Even though we won this year,<LINE>
//I didn't fulfill my role as Toho Gakuen's<LINE>
//captain or as a teammate.<END>

//You don't have to quit the team.<LINE>
//It's more appropriate for me to do so.<END>

//I made that decision<LINE>
//when I changed my mind<LINE>
//about not letting you play.<LINE>
//However, we were still able to win, Hyuga.<END>

//...<END>

//But I'll work as a coach<LINE>
//in another school, and I'll do it<LINE>
//my way.<LINE>
//Who knows, we might be opponents<LINE>
//when we meet again, Hyuga.<END>

//B-but, coach!<END>

//What will happen to the other players<LINE>
//if you resign?<END>

//If you're so confident, then<LINE>
//you'll have to take responsibility for<LINE>
//each of your actions in the future.<LINE>
//It's your duty.<END>

//Coach.<END>

//Alright, end of discussion!<LINE>
//Let's go!<END>

//Members of Toho Gakuen's club,<LINE>
//form an honor guard!<END>

//Pay tribute to Coach Kitazume!<END>

//Thank you!<END>

//You were good students, boys.<END>

//Toho and Nankatsu ended in a tie.<LINE>
//Both teams were unable to<LINE>
//decide the winner. Therefore,<LINE>
//they are both proclaimed as victors!<END>

//It's over.<END>

//Draw.<END>

//As the referee blows the final whistle,<LINE>
//the players from both teams<LINE>
//fall to their knees.<LINE>
//The disappointment is too great.<END>

//This shows how much the players<LINE>
//fought hard during this match.<END>

//The crowd applauds both teams<LINE>
//who gave their best<LINE>
//during a difficult match.<END>

//This is your first championship,<LINE>
//Hyuga!<END>

//We won, captain!<END>

//Tsubasa...<END>

//Hyuga.<END>

//I ultimately didn't manage to beat you.<LINE>
//We ended up with a draw.<END>

//But... if you had played at your best,<LINE>
//the result might have been different.<END>

//It was your presence on the field, Hyuga,<LINE>
//that allowed me to give it my all.<LINE>
//Toho Gakuen is an exceptional team<LINE>
//thanks to its captain.<LINE>
//You defeated me.<END>

//Tsubasa... I suppose this puts an end<LINE>
//to our rivalry. At least for now.<END>

//Yes.<END>
