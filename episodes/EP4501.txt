//Coach!<END>

//What is it, Misugi?<END>

//I want to play until the end of the match!<END>

//I feel great!<LINE>
//I will rest during the break,<LINE>
//so I'll be fit enough<LINE>
//to give it my all<LINE>
//during the thirty minutes<LINE>
//of the second half!<END>

//That's not what your doctor said!<END>

//But I absolutely have to participate<LINE>
//in this match! To block Tsubasa<LINE>
//and beat Nankatsu...<END>

//If you see that I'm not feeling well,<LINE>
//replace me immediately!<END>

//Very well...<LINE>
//I'll take you out<LINE>
//at the slightest sign of fatigue.<END>

//Thank you very much, coach!<END>

//You have played<LINE>
//a perfect match so far. Your defense<LINE>
//against Nankatsu has been impeccable.<LINE>
//In the second half, as usual,<LINE>
//you will attack by passing<LINE>
//the ball to Misugi.<END>

//Since Misugi and Tsubasa are both<LINE>
//midfielders, the battle will be tough.<END>

//So don't hesitate to come<LINE>
//and give Misugi a hand.<LINE>
//If you manage to play this match<LINE>
//as you have played the previous ones,<LINE>
//you should crush Nankatsu.<END>

//Yes, coach!<END>

//OK! I'll give it my all<LINE>
//for the last thirty minutes!<LINE>
//We'll crush Nankatsu!<LINE>
//We'll be the ones<LINE>
//to come away with the victory flag!<END>

//Yeah!<END>

//Only thirty minutes left...<LINE>
//I'll fight to the end<LINE>
//against Tsubasa and Nankatsu!<END>

//And we're now entering the last thirty<LINE>
//minutes of this highly anticipated final.<LINE>
//And the kickoff is taken.<END>
