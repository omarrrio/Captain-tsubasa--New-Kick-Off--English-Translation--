//Ha! Nobody can stop me!<END>

//The pass, Napoléon!<END>

//Pierre!<END>

//Where are you looking? Take this!<LINE>
//Razor tackle!<END>

//That was a very hard tackle<LINE>
//from Souda!<LINE>
//Nevertheless, Napoléon manages to pass<LINE>
//the ball!<END>

//But Souda, carried away by his momentum,<LINE>
//takes out Napoléon!<END>

//This can't be!<END>

//Huh?<END>

//Pierre has the ball, the referee decides<LINE>
//to let the advantage play!<END>

//Let's go!<END>

//Misaki immediately goes after him!<END>

//I'm not going to let you do it<LINE>
//so easily!<END>

//I'll stop him!<END>

//Ishizaki comes to Misaki's aid.<END>

//I can't believe it!<LINE>
//Pierre deliberately charges at Ishizaki!<END>

//What is he thinking?<LINE>
//I'll get the ball back!<END>

//Huh! He disappeared?<END>

//Oh, what a jump!<LINE>
//Pierre remains suspended<LINE>
//like a butterfly in the sky!<END>

//Hehe...<LINE>
//You're going to see what I'm capable of.<LINE>
//I'll reveal my...<END>

//Slider shoot!<END>

//Pierre shoots from afar!<END>

//A shot from afar?<LINE>
//Is it a curled shot<LINE>
//like Tsubasa and Diaz,<LINE>
//or a powerful shot<LINE>
//like Hyuga or Schneider?<END>

//There doesn't seem to be any spin on<LINE>
//the ball, and it's not as powerful<LINE>
//as Tiger and Fire shots!<LINE>
//I'll stop it without any problem!<END>

//Wakashimazu dives!<END>

//Wh-what?<END>

//Ohhh, it's a gooooooooooal!<LINE>
//Wakashimazu was about to catch<LINE>
//the ball, but it instantly fell<LINE>
//and bounced into the goal!<END>

//W-wait, what kind of shot was that?<END>

//Pierre treats us to a new shot!<END>

//Did you see that? It's the Slider shoot!<END>

//Oh! But what's happening<LINE>
//on the other side of the field?<LINE>
//Things are heating up between Napoléon and Souda!<END>

//whistle blow<END>

//Players from both teams rush<LINE>
//to separate them.<END>

//It seems that Napoléon complained<LINE>
//to Souda about his tackle,<LINE>
//and they came to blows.<END>

//Yellow card for both players!<LINE>
//The tension is rising!<END>
