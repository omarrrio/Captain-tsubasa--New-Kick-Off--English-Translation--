//Taki!<END>

//Tsubasa passes the ball<LINE>
//and makes an acceleration!<END>

//Tsubasa, catch it!<END>

//Taki returns the pass!<LINE>
//The ball is literally floating<LINE>

//And they fall down together!<END>

//Tsubasa, are you okay?<END>

//I'm fine. It was nothing.<END>

//You say that, but you're holding your shoulder...<END>

//Why do you always push yourself<LINE>

//Huh?<END>

//Since it was a pass from a teammate Taki,<LINE>
//he wanted to score at all costs,<LINE>
//even if it meant sacrificing himself.<END>

//That's just how Tsubasa is.<END>

//Tsubasa...<END>

//Ahaha.<LINE>
//But I'm perfectly fine.<LINE>
//Don't worry about me.<END>

//Well, the match isn't over yet.<END>

//...<END>

//Thanks to Sawada's clearance from<LINE>
//Toho they managed to get a corner. Now<LINE>
//the condition of Wakashimazu and Tsubasa<LINE>
//after their fall is what worries us.<END>
