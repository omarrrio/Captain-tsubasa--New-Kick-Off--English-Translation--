//A pass heading for Misugi!<END>

//Honma, Ichinose, and Sanada,<LINE>
//the three players who have been playing<LINE>
//together since elementary school,<LINE>
//are now in the opposing<LINE>
//team's half of the field!<LINE>
//What will Misugi do?<END>

//Oh... Misugi is dribbling towards the goal!<END>

//Stop Misugi!<LINE>
//Give him a taste of<LINE>
//Meiwa-Higashi's tackles!<END>

//The players from Meiwa-Higashi<LINE>
//are attempting to tackle Misugi<LINE>
//one after the other!<END>

//Look!<END>

//!<END>

//Two players from Meiwa-Higashi tackled<LINE>
//at the same time, yet Misugi<LINE>
//easily avoided them!<END>

//Misugi continues to dribble!<LINE>
//Only the goalkeeper and two defenders<LINE>
//remain between him and the goal!<END>

//I'm going to stop you!<END>

//If the defense fails,<LINE>
//the Meiwa-Higashi goalkeeper will be<LINE>
//face-to-face with Misugi!<LINE>
//And once again, the two players<LINE>
//attack at the same time!<END>

//Their tackles are perfectly timed!<END>

//Meiwa-Higashi's tackles<LINE>
//stopped Misugi and the ball...<END>

//No! They didn't manage to intercept<LINE>
//the ball!<LINE>
//Misugi lifted the ball slightly<LINE>
//and jumped to avoid the attack.<END>

//I'm going to score!<END>

//And he shoots!<END>

//Goal!<LINE>
//The goalkeeper couldn't even react!<END>

//The dribbling, ball control, shot,<LINE>
//everything was perfect!<LINE>
//Misugi's genius in its purest form!<END>

//Hmm... I didn't think<LINE>
//I'd let a goal in<LINE>
//while facing Misugi alone...<END>
